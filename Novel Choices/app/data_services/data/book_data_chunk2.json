The story is told through the mind of Jacob, a nonogenarian (yes, I had to look that up) resident of a nursing home, who was orphaned his last week of veterinary school.  Jacob discovers that his parents, struggling along with everyone else through the end of the Great Depression, had impoverished themselves to keep him in college.  Broke himself, and unable to focus enough to complete his exams, he desperately jumps a train and runs away from his life.The train he jumps happens to belong to The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Barely avoiding getting thrown off the train, he is befriended by a few of the circus workers, and becomes the veterinarian for the show's menagerie of exotic animals.This look behind the scenes of the train circuses is enough in itself to carry the book.  Sara Gruen's ability to place herself behind the eyes of a 93 (or is it 90?) year-old man is gripping.  The two combined give the story a depth that makes you want to keep turning the pages.The flaws in the story are not enough to make it founder but just enough to keep this from being a five-star read.  In particular, Jacob's ability to turn his back when those he loves are endangered is at odds with what we see of his nature at other times.  The encapsulated explanations for his behavior notwithstanding, his integrity is deeply flawed in a manner that can't be explained away, and yet the author ignores it.  We are thus left cheated from seeing not just how Jacob affects the circus, but how deeply the circus affects Jacob.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent read!", "unixReviewTime": 1294531200, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2011"}

I assumed this was Gruen's first novel and was quite surprised to find out it was her third.The morality of the story fell very flat as well.  The characters kind of want to do the right thing, but I wasn't sold on their move toward adultery based on initial attraction.  A lot of people feel an attraction toward someone who is not their spouse.  That doesn't mean it is right or destined.  Greun's inability to convince me that Jacob and Marlena were any different was a major failing of the novel for me.How many meals can people in the Great Depression skip without even thinking about it.  At least a dozen times through the book people skipped meals because they didn't feel like eating.I had high expectations so I'm judging harshly.  Did not meet expectations.

Her use of narration and relaying events, like a traveling circus during the Depression, make this such a rich and captivating novel.  This novel was hard to put down and I often found myself thinking about Jacob, Marlena, Walter, Rosie and the many other colorful characters.  I found Jacob at 90 (or 93) funny and sharp.  I had worked in a nursing home through college so I found his behavior totally realistic, humorous and sad at the same time.  The younger Jacob's innocence, quixotic actions and love of the animal menagerie hook you right into the story and captures your imagination as you go through the Benzini Brothers Most Amazing Show.  This story of the travelling circus tragedy is amazingly well relayed.  I didn't want the story to end! So, imagine how ecstatic I was when I saw the audio book in our public library.  I guess I had not been read to enough as a child, so I found myself totally engrossed in this story, again, during my commute to work.  The readers' voices and intonations transported me to another time and place.  It felt like good radio of old (not that I come from that era, but I imagine people glued to their sets listening to latest adventure story).  Even though I knew the outcome of the story, I loved listening to it.  Water for Elephants was our last book club pick, and everyone enjoyed the story.

Good parts: The depiction of human and animal life in a seedy Depression-era circus is fascinating. The implausible adventures of the protagonist Jacob, a veterinary student who joins the circus, Marlena, the married acrobat he loves, the circus animals in Jacob's care, and the oddball, desperate circus folk, keep you in suspense and turning the pages. Gruen risks ridicule with her over-the-top romantic ending, which I won't give away, but there's something endearing about her having taken that risk. Bad parts: The admittedly engaging human characters are too one-dimensionally virtuous or nasty. Gruen, though she capably creates a world in which you can immerse yourself and carries the story along at a good clip, is no literary stylist. I did not care for the bookend device of beginning and ending the story with Jacob looking back on his life from a nursing home. If I were rating this on writing quality, I'd give it two stars.

Reading this tale makes you believe you are on board this Depression-era circus train, complete with all the sounds and smells.A great novel must combine such a travelouge with interesting, human characters, and Sara Gruen has accomplished that.

Also, Jacob certainly commits his share of moral transgressions (and is ready to commit murder) in the course of his growth into the decent man who so bored the New Yorker.The Publisher's Weekly reviewer complained of a predictable ending, and that's not true, either: it took me until the last chapter to see where Jacob's journey would end, and the final twist is a heartwarming one.  Maybe that's what some too-cynical professional reviewers really don't like: the idea that, in literature as in real life, some stories are uplifting ones.I'm a writer as well as a voracious and nit-picking reader, and I don't give five-star reviews.

The story is set during the 1930's depression and takes place primarily on a traveling circus train.  Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned, is hired as the veterinarian for the circus. Through Jacob's gaze, we are introduced to the inner workings of the greatest show on earth as proclaimed by Uncle Al, owner of the Benzini Brothers circus.  We learn of the work required to roll out and pick up a circus as well as the cruelty with which the men charged with this work are treated.  While the animals, performances and circus atmosphere are well rendered by the author I found the class structure created within the traveling circus of particular interest; a structure whereby the lowest members of the circus team may be guaranteed a meal but not necessarily a wage or a life.  Equally interesting to me is the depiction of geriatric care, familial and professional, afforded Jacob during his twilight years.  Gruen did an excellent job of capturing the desolation of aging without the care and proximity of your family.\"Water for Elephants\" is a well crafted tale of adventure, love and murder.  The characters are memorable and the language easily accessible and imagistic.  This is an entertaining read but I must admit it dispelled any quixotic notions that I associate with running off with the circus; that was hard and dangerous work then. You were luck if you left the show with your life and even luckier if you left with a life.  For this reader, It'll be enough to watch the next circus that comes to town and remember the men and women that whose hard work made it possible then and keeps the show on the road now.

For Jacob Jankowski, the circus is just about a last chance that fate has given him after some untimely luck.  Joining with the Benzini Brothers to care for their animals, Jacob is launched into a world that's strange and unusual for him, and provides the backdrop for reminiscing when he's 90 and in a nursing home many years later.With vivid imagery, you're taken into the world of the circus and into the lives of these characters.  The characters themselves are very believable and fleshed out, especially August the animal trainer.  His viciousness and mood swings were gripping and his evolution into the bad guy had me sitting there waiting for more.  And as the husband of Marlena, Jacob's romantic interest, August had plenty of opportunity to be jealous and controlling.  Even secondary characters were well formed and fleshed out, giving the book even more life and character.  Even Rosie the elephant becomes a character that you fall in love with by the end of the book.The author tackles a bunch of interesting subjects and has obviously researched them all thoroughly.  From the drinking of Sterno fluid during Prohibition and its effects afterwards to the history of the circus originally as an event for men to get on with their hoochy koochy stuff, Gruen provides a well researched take on everything.  This research shows and if you're a history nut like me you will not be disappointed.What I had a slight problem with was the love story.  It was very sweet, but it was also somewhat stereotypical.  Boy comes along and becomes the knight in shining armor to the damsel in distress.  It was still a believable, romantic, and heartwarming love story, and it makes you remember that back in the day, people thought that women were property of men.  Even in the circus with people protecting one another there was no escape from domestic violence.The story in the past and in the nursing home blended seamlessly and the transitions were impeccable.  Gruen crafted a well researched and well written love story that, though with its small faults, was a very good novel.  Gruen is definitely an author that I want to watch and read more of.VERDICT: Even though it suffers from a stereotypical romance, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a well-crafted, heartwarming novel that keeps you glued to your seat wanting more of the circus and the atmosphere.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A heartwarming, enchanting book you'll want to check out", "unixReviewTime": 1320019200, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2011"}

Written as a historical novel, it reminded me very much of Nicholas Spark's The Notebook, with the main character being an elderly man and telling the story through memories of his youth.Preparing to take his final exams as a veterinary student at university, Jacob Jankowski receives some shocking news about his family which sends his future into a spin. Abandoning his exams, he leaves school and hops on board a train in the middle of the night. This train is home to a travelling circus, and it's through the characters he meets there that he becomes a vet to the animals on board and enters a world he never imagined. He quickly becomes part of the family and is soon caught up in a love triangle with the beautiful Marlena, a circus performer who holds a particular soft spot for the star of the show, an intelligent and lovable elephant, Rosie.The novel is so beautifully written and will touch the hearts of all animal lovers. Sara Gruen really did her research into the circus era and the book is even peppered with images of old circus photographs.

However, towards the end, the 1931 story devolves into a bit of a soap opera the I didn't really enjoy. Other than that I found it a lively read...but I wanted more about Rosie, the Polish-understanding elephant who everyone thinks is dumb because she doesn't understand English. Every moment where she is on the page, the book is highly entertaining, but I found parts of the book slow-moving and lackluster when the story so lends its self to being bouncy and light (it is about a circus, Miss Gruen!). People \"locked eyes\" 10 too many times for me. I loved the parts when Jacob is 90~~or is it 93~~(he can't remember)and his body, his family and life, in general has betrayed him. If you are looking for some lightweight entertainment and a quick read, I would recommend this book. The biggest thing that bugged me about this edition (and many other books) are the book club discussion questions at the end of the book.

I knew I would eventually see the movie so I looked up the book to see what it was about.  When I read the many positive reviews, I figured I should go ahead and read it before I saw the movie.  When the Kindle edition dropped to $4.17, I figured I wouldn't be out much money.  I am very happy I did.The story flowed very well and the writing was easy and accessible without seeming juvenile.  I found myself drawn to the older Jacob. Right out of high school, I worked at an assisted living home while attending college and I was also extremely close to my late grandmother. I thought that the portrayal of an elderly person feeling trapped by the limitations of their failing body (and sometimes their mind) was heart-wrenching yet spot-on. In your heart and your \"inner dialogue\" you don't feel any older than you did 60+ years ago, yet everything about your physical being has changed and the world around you has changed as well.The atmosphere and the feel of the book was wonderful. I felt like I was riding in that train car along with Jacob and Walter.  I felt the hurt that Jacob felt when he was orphaned, confused and lost.  I felt scared and anxious along with them, fearing that their \"stowaway\" in their car would be found.  I felt the elephant's fear and happiness.  I could almost hear the sounds of the circus, smell the peanuts and greasy food.The only thing I wasn't 100% convinced on was the relationship between Jacob and Marlena.  I felt it from Jacob, but not really from Marlena.  I felt like she was a weak character and there were moments I actually wondered if she gravitated towards Jacob because August was so cruel and hard to live with.  That is honestly the only negative thing I can say about this story.I think if you are looking for a real romantic read (like a Nicholas Sparks novel), I wouldn't recommend this. It has moments of romance but I didn't feel that was the main storyline. I got more out of it from the circus standpoint and the old man/young man's life.  I will be interested to see how \"romantic\" they make the movie (I am guessing by the poster, commercials and lead actors that it will be the main point of the movie).  However I will still see it.I do recommend this book.  VERY much worth the time spent reading and worth the price.

After a few friends read, they assured me that I would be able to handle it, so I added it to the reading list for a class I am teaching this summer.  Boy, am I glad that I did!Part of this book is set in a nursing home, where an elderly Jacob is living and waiting for his famiy to visit so they can bring him to the circus.  The majority of this book is set in a circus, a second rate circus who really wants to be Ringling Bros.  Jacob joins the circus and is considered their vet, even though he does not have his official degree from Cornell.  He meets the circus folk and instantly forms a love/hate relationship with August and an attraction relationship with August's wife, Marlena.Circus life is not easy and this book shows it.  Animals are treated as property and receive basic, minimum care.  There is a huge class distinction between workers and performers.  Money is given out in order of the caste system.  There are nice people like Walter, Earl and Greg.  There are evil people like Uncle Al.  The most despicable character in this book is August.  He abused his wife, his animals and his workers.  I was hoping for justice and felt satisfied with how August ends up.There is also some not so dark relationships in this book. Jacob and Marlena share a deep connection and they spend time together, even though it is forbidden.  Walter loves his dog Queenie.  Jacob has a connection with the animals, especially Bobo and Rosie.  Camel gets Jacob a job with the show.  There are good people in this book and readers will root for them.A difficult at times book to read, it was also powerful.

Also, it's about an older man reflecting back on his life. That alone should seem to confuse someone, but it was done seamlessly. A couple chapters of back-story, how it was back in the 30s and a chapter or two as the older man. Doing it that way, you get a feel of different personalities of the same man. How he was sweet and nicer in his younger days and grew to a grumpy old man.What I liked about this book was reading about the circus life and the history aspect of it all. It's clearly shown that Sara did her research when it came to writing that time period. Things were so in detail, I felt as if I was there.However, some things seemed a bit much. At the end, when I was reading the Author's Notes about this book, it mentions all the things that happened in the story were inspired by real events. The thing is though, not all of them happened to every circus. It was a random circus here and there. She ended up throwing all of the together in this one circus which was just too much and overcrowded. I really didn't think there needed to be that much in there. It makes it unrealistic to have it all happen.Supposedly there was a romance between Jacob and Marlena but to be honest, I didn't see it. I don't see how she was in love with him and I don't see how he was in love with her. I expected something to show they loved one another, I expected to be happy about it, but I was just lost and confused. It wasn't until Jacob kissed her that I realized that there was supposed to be a romance blooming there. I think it was then, about halfway through the book, that Sara realized she didn't have the romance in there and had to throw it in. It was stiff and unnatural. I like smiling at a romance that blossoms. I didn't smile.It honestly felt like they just \"liked\" each other because they both didn't like August, Marlena's husband. That's not enough of a reason to \"fall in love\". Or to cheat on your husband.There were a couple \"mature\" scenes in there. Two scenes were more sex related, though Sara doesn't go into too much detail about that. Well, yes and no. The first one is when Jacob is treated to a little something by the circus... slut. There were some details in there, which I skipped. I just was not into reading that. Sorry.The second one was with Marlena which was just a simple, they were in bed together. The fact that one is more detailed while the other is not is a bit confusing. The first one, Jacob was drunk and didn't know much of anything going on, yet he described things so well. Yet the second one, which was with the one whom he LOVED, was a simple line. There were no details, nothing. I thought if it was going to be with someone you loved, you would go into more detail than one curious drunken fling.Which was another issue with this book. The details weren't spread out enough in this. Some places it would be too much, while other places there wouldn't be enough. There was no balance in things.There was a good amount of language in here as well. I don't really find the need to have so many words in there cuss words. Especially to have the F word in there so many times. It was always F--- this, F--- that throughout, which I wasn't crazy about.Though, what I did enjoy was the fact that Sara wrote a male's POV though she is female. I honestly didn't know a woman wrote this until the end. I thought it was a man, due to some of the things that were written. I must say she did a male's pov very well.Would I recommend this book? Maybe.

Against that backdrop, I was very moved by this book, especially by the parts where the old man was narrating. I loved the spirited way he interacted with his nurses and the other residents, and his inner dialogue as he grudgingly allowed himself to be taken care of. It reminded me so much of the things we would see when we would visit PopPop; it made me wish I had more time to give to my relative before he passed away. I also loved how the narrator's voice sounded old-fashioned in the context of the modern day scenes, yet somehow contemporary in his flashback scenes.

He falls in love with one of the show girls, who happens to be married to the lead trainer. Conflict ensues, and somewhere along the line an elephant appears. (Personally, I felt the elephant could have been given an even larger role; she was wonderful to read about.)The plot is simple enough; will he get the girl, or will she stay with her husband? My one complaint is that some of the examples the author gave on why the husband wasn't a model citizen weren't all that horrible in my mind. Yes, he does some appalling things, but one of his supposed despicable decisions was... well.... practical, in my mind. Maybe I'm just a cold-hearted monster, but you'll see what I mean when you read the book.Also, I felt the 'twist' at the end of the book was more akin to a 'trick' as readers are deliberately misled by the subtle revision of a key scene, but I am willing to overlook it given the pleasure I received from the book overall.A word of warning to parents of pre-teens who may want to read this book because of the movie that just came out: Descriptions of masturbation, strip teases, and sexual encounters all make appearances in this book. As a mother, I would recommend previewing these sections and taking your pre-teen's maturity level into consideration before giving them the book. It's all fairly tame, but it is mentioned.

Old Jacob is clearly frustrated by the physical limitations of his aged body, and how small his world has become while living in the nursing home.

This reader likes stories, and the author either created or embellished great stories of circus folklore [reader Author's Note at end].And, amid the story there is a common group of guys who are the comedy which hold the story together - otherwise it may be too depressing and too violent for some readers. The three eclectic characters are the foul-mouthed hard-tempered dwarf clown whose mother sold him to the circus, combined with the protagonist - a Cornell educated veterinarian, protagonist Jacob Jankowski., who falls into emotionally hard times -  and the old man of the circus family whose overindulgence of jake makes him become a victim of the paralyzing Jake Walk Effect, as him limbs wither along with his mind from the chemical's destructive forces. Each with his emotional or physical scars, enlightens the others with dry wit and warm compassion as each struggles to continue to live on the circus train where many mornings are greeted with discoveries of losses of others from \"red lightings\" -  those who are not economically valuable to the \"family\" are thrown off the train while in transit at the latest of hours.Amid many stereotypical characters - aren't most circus characters stereoptyped by this time? - is the greatest monster of them all: a paranoid schizophrenic Jew named August. A love triangle grows between August, his lovely wife Marlena and Jacob. Things get out of hand and at one time the author has Jacob think, \"It occurs to me that my conscience stopped me from killing August at the very moment someone was attempting to carry out his orders to kill me.\" \"Prizzi's Honor\" meets the big top.If there is any criticism of this book, it is not anything extraordinary.  Some of the dialogue was not totally sharp, but few writers can write great dialogue.  Dialogue is the hardest task of any fiction writer. This dialogue is very good. Just not great.I also take my hat off to her delivery of the story through a young man's eyes.  His feelings about women, his feelings about anger, and other items delivered through this book are not reflective of the author's gender.

The way it moved the audience, from the bittersweet past to the present, and from this we were hooked.  The main character, Jacob Jankowski, is extremely well written.  The story is a colorful works of his life, in his early 20's.  The Great Depression hits him particularly hard.  A student in Cornell University, in Veterinary School, his parents are killed in an accident.  Jacob drops out of school, unable to pay his way.  In his own world of sadness, he comes across a wacky, dangerous group of circus folk, who call themselves the Benzini Bros.  Jacob lands himself a position as a veterinarian.  We emotionally become entangled in Jacob's downward spiral and passionately wish him to find his way through these, well written, but dangerous group of people.  We watch as he hits his lowests points.  We see him hit poverty, then beaten, crying, bleeding, loved and even see him drunk and hungover.  He is truly a rarity in the literary world, and when I finished this book I felt as if I made a friend.  My favorite character is Rosie, a deeply loving, horribly abused elephant.  I actually had points in the book, where I placed the book down, and had to take a break, because I was becoming so enraged because of a character named August, who relentlessly beats Rosie.  Some of the scenes are brutal.  I rooted for her the entire book as you will too.  It's amazing how such a warm presence she was after the book was finished.

Now this is a good book! Immediately engrossed, I had a hard time putting it down as I read the story of Jacob Jankowski and his reminiscence of days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth--otherwise known as a train circus in 1930's America.A talented writer and storyteller, Sara Gruen takes readers on a bumpy and tense train ride through history. This tale defines Americana. There is no evidence of author here--simply narrator telling the story from Jacob's perspective (is he 91 or 93 years old?). I liked everything about the book, but primarily it was the crafting I liked best about this reading experience.Seamlessly, Gruen weaves together the modern day voice of this old man, a Cornell-educated veterinarian, abandoned in a nursing home--a.k.a. assisted living facility--and his memories of three months spent as the accidental veterinarian on a traveling circus. Just before his final exams, he learns his parents have been killed in a car accident and this is what sets the story in motion. Once he hops aboard a train, which he soon learns is a circus train, he falls in love with a pink-sequined performer, Marlena, and battles her schizophrenic husband, August, who happens to be his boss. Jacob, a sensitive and innocent soul, is highly likeable and befriends most of the animals aboard. Most unforgettably is a \"Polish\" elephant by the name of Rosie. But he also endears himself to his roommate, a dwarf named Walter, and a stowaway named Camel. One can't help but root for Jacob through the entire story.

They did a number of adaptations for the screenplay that made it work better. Like August was the owner in the movie, but in the book he wasn't but he was in charge of the animals and Uncle Al was the owner. At any rate, the movie was made for a PG-13 rating and though there were some mild situations and language, it was tolerable, vs. the book, where there was a lot of swearing and a few lewd descriptions that weren't necessary for the story in order for it to be a good one. If not for the cheesy sexual stuff and multiple F-bombs dropped, I would have enjoyed the book more. The story itself is quite good, but the delivery of it was lacking because of the language and overly-detailed sexual situations. So if I were to recommend one, I'd tell people to choose the movie over the book. It's less crude, and ultimately, a more satisfying experience.

The life seems awful on many levels, yet, at the same time, so exciting and alive that a part of you is jealous of the characters living it---like the sailors of the British Navy in the Aubrey/Maturin series (seeMaster and Commander (Aubrey Maturin Series)).The romantic scenes are less well executed, and the author does not well capture the sexual feelings of a 22-year-old man.

(in a good way, that is!)I am totally confused by some of the recent reviews that talk about Jacobs morals, etc. blah blah blah.  I think these people should go back and read the whole book again because i really found Jacob to be a likeable character and think he was one of the few in circus who DID have morals and a conscience!Anyway, this book was moving, funny and incredibly interesting (i just found the whole circus idea really fascinating) and I'm not ashamed to admit that i loved this book!

Honestly though with all the newly discovered titles, authors, backlists, series, etc I fear I'll never get to revisit my beloveds anytime soon. But when (and if) that day comes, Water for Elephants will be on that list!I've never really been a big circus fan - reading about them or attending them, but I liked the atmosphere of circus life of the 1930s. It is both beautiful and gritty in detail. After reading this I must read more Great Depression era books. I can't imagine how hard it was to live in that time period and I find it fascinating and frightening.Bouncing between young and old Jacob's POV was actually a great way to read the novel. I felt as if I was re-living Jacob's memories as he did, rather than being told a story.  Jacob is utterly honest and humble as a young man and it's hard not to like his character. Harsh reality is thrust upon him after he tragically loses his parents and is forced to find a way to survive without money or family. Normal life is hard but living life under the famous Benzini Brothers' big top is even harder. Despite elderly Jacob being extremely (and understandably) cranky (I probably wouldn't want to be around him - family or not) Gruen does a spectacular job portraying his life and state of mind at the assisted living facility.Gruen actually does a spectacular job at a lot of things. She delivers a cast of characters that become just as important to me as Jacob, Marlena, and even Rosie, the larger-than-life elephant that is supposed to save the Benzini Brothers show from biting the dust. The characters are really the hands-down winner for me in this story. But it certainly was coupled with some amazing story-telling.I think I didn't give this one a solid 5 stars because the ending didn't quite sit well with me. While I'm glad of the outcome for Jacob I felt the HEA was sort of - slapped on, for lack of a better term. Kind of like \"Come on, let's hurry and wrap it up here\" ending...if that makes sense. It's happy (which made me happy; I happen to really like Jacob). Maybe a little too convenient for my tastes though. However, I have a hunch that if the ending were any different I'd still have a problem with it. Maybe I just didn't want Jacob's story to end *shrugs* ...Definitely a good thing about a book, if you ask me!As a side note I have not seen the movie adaptation but I want to.

I have read a few reviews regarding the volgar and violent content of the book. Let's face it, this is what happened (or at least similar to what was so to say). There were no strict enforcements on labor law or even animal laws such as PETA back then. This was life; workers and performers thought of it as such. It is unpleasant to read and even learn about but it was a different time and a different world. Just like other tragic times in history (wars, genocides, slavery, etc.). As for the volgar parts, like the sexual scenes, just part of life back then too and I suppose Ms. Gruen wanted it to be properly formatted.This book is very descriptive, and emotional, has an excellent plot and an unexpected ending. This was unlike any other endings to be honest, and I was shocked and pleased with it.

In short... he's no better off than when he started, but... all of that is about to change when he hears a train is coming his way.  With no clue as to where he is, or where to go next, Jacob makes a decision; hop the train and see where it takes him, little did he know that that would be the circus. Finding himself knee deep in the Benzini Brother's most spectacular show on Earth; Jacob quickly discovers that his \"previous\" life may (in fact) do him justice in his \"new\" one, and takes on a job as the circus' official veterinarian. With animals however, comes their performers and that's where things start to get sticky. Marlena is beautiful, kind, smart, and more importantly... taken. Will Jacob be able to control his feelings for the one person he is forbidden from caring about? Why and how are people disappearing off of the train, and what REALLY happened that fateful day when the world flipped upside down and all hell broke loose?Gruen is very clearly a masterful storyteller.  Not only did she deliver a gasp worthy love story, but the background in which her story took place was so artfully crafted that after only 1 chapter I found it impossible to put down.  The detail involved in creating the grit of a traveling circus (while at the same time tacking such issues as the Great Depression and Prohibition) was genius, and to do it through the eyes of 1 man at very different times in his life (23 and 90 or 93) added a depth and emotional connection that would have otherwise been lost if penned differently. The story as a whole was perfectly plotted, leaving zero downtime for the readers mind to wonder off or lose focus of the moral dilemmas at hand, and at the end of the day became: just another one of those books that sucks you in and doesn't let you go.Overall...a wonderful book and an interesting peek into classic American history.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: animals may not be able to talk to you, but they can understand you.

I fell in love with the characters and the author's writing style and truly hope to read more of her work - she has such a natural gift!I HIGHLY recommend this novel to absolutely anyone - I think people of all ages, backgrounds and interests will find something in it to relate to and to learn from.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dont read all the detailed reviews!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1187136000, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2007"}

I'm aware I'm in the minority, but I can't honestly say I enjoyed this book.  It was very predictable, and the characters were wooden.  Marlena has zero depth--and Joseph isn't much better.  They fall in love, but it seems more like the affair happens because the author wrote it into the plot, not because these were two developed, real people whose minds and hearts shared something magical.  A few of the secondary characters have more detail, but they never go beyond superficial personality traits.The elephant is the absolute best part, and once I read that Gruen was inspired by old stories and photographs of real circus elephants and performers, I wished she'd gone ahead and written a non-fiction book so she could really delve into the struggle of the era and the horrible treatment of these animals.  She makes aspects of the circus interesting--in fact, that's why I kept reading even after I'd given up on the story having any real complexity or resonance, but the whole book is littered with anachronistic language that disturbs the realism she's aiming for.She's trying to get at some very deep issues (mental illness, extra-marital affairs, spousal abuse, the traumas of the Great Depression) but it's all very superficial.  She never quite digs deep enough to give these real complexity or power, so all of the characters have very obvious, stereotypical, predictably shallow reactions to these deep issues, and I was left feeling a bit like I was reading a kid's slightly juvenile interpretation of events.  Overall, disappointing and even a little simplistic.  The frame of Joseph in the old folks' home is the richest and most emotionally complicated part of the text--until the ending, which is utterly unrealistic and saccharine.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Doesn't live up to the hype", "unixReviewTime": 1300924800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2011"}

Walter the clown and Camel are both very sympathetic characters, though Walter's true nature is revealed slowly from being a crusty, mean spirited person to one with great compassion.

This book was a departure for me, one that I took on the faith of the 1600+ positive reviews.  Those reviews misled me, I'm afraid.It's mystifying why so many reviewers loved this book.  It's not a bad story, a fairly straightforward narrative without any literary flourishes, written in plain language and present tense. Certainly the author did her research so she could use the right lingo and details.  Flash-forwards to the protagonist's current life in a nursing home only provide a pretense for the ending, unfortunately.  The plot is so thin that until about 3/4ths of the way through, I was convinced there wasn't one.  Likewise, the characters are fairly thinly realized, except for the \"paranoid schizophrenic\" villain and the intelligent elephant, Rosie.  I found myself wondering why I even liked the protagonist, who fashioned himself as a kind of savior for a couple of victimized lesser players.  Recently bereaved, the protagonist's experience of bereavement is completely absent from the book, which I found unrealistic at best.That said, I was surprised that I stuck it out and read to the end, which is why I didn't give the book a lower rating.  In all honesty, the last quarter of the book is quite possibly the best, when the main character finally acts on all his misguided desires. However, the final scene disappointed me; it seemed a bit too contrived.Light reading, this one.  If you want to read for 30 minutes before bed, this is a good bet, because it doesn't not require much thought or deconstruction.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "What's the hype about?", "unixReviewTime": 1237939200, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2009"}

Also, I scanned a few 1- and 2-star reviews before I read the book, to see what some people didn't like, so some of my review is addressing others' opinions.First, the narrators for the audio book I thought did a pretty good job. The young Jacob did a wonderful job using varying voices for the various circus people and I forgot they were all spoken by the same person. The old Jacob's voice was great for a crotchety old man, but still clear enough to understand. 4 out of 5 stars for narration.I thought the story overall was good. I did not feel as much of a connection to the characters as I would have liked and that may be due to the \"shallow\" writing that some people have complained about in reviews. I did laugh out loud in the car listening to some of the narration by the \"old Jacob\" though, I thought his character was amusing.I don't claim to know much of anything factual about the early 20th century or life in the circus (then or now) for that matter. With that said, I thought the descriptions of this FICTIONAL circus and recent college graduate veterinarian were nicely done. I felt like I understood what the narrator was talking about and how he was feeling (most of the time).Yes, there was some animal cruelty and there was some sex/masturbation. While I don't particularly enjoy reading about animals being hurt or neglected, I felt that the things they were doing seemed as if they might have been done during that time period due to desperation/ignorance or that was just what everyone else did. As for the sex/masturbation, again, I don't generally enjoy reading those things, but I thought they might have been appropriate for the time and characters.  How else is a little person going to get physical pleasure in a time before \"political correctness\" where his mother SOLD him to the circus to be a circus freak/clown because of his stature?  The sex between the characters was inevitable and if someone is so offended by it that they quit the book, maybe they should go back to reading Dick and Jane (unless you're also offended by the word/name Dick).Overall, I enjoyed the story. Interesting time period, good characters, and good narration from two different perspectives of the same character.

It was not at all what I expected.  I knew it was about a circus, and obviously for the title, an elephant was involved.  What I was not prepared for however, was the cruelty it showed.  And I don't doubt for a minute, that even though this was fiction, that these atrocities didn't happen in real circuses.We are introduced to a death in the prologue.  While it is fuzzy and hard to tell who's who, we are witnesses to a scene that the narrator, Jacob, has viewed and never forgotten. Mayhem abounds as we discover that the menagerie of a circus is on the stampede.We are then reintroduced to Jacob, many years later, as he is a resident at a nursing home.  He is ninety three, or ninety one, he can't keep it straight and a circus is in town and being set up within sight of the nursing home.  This causes him to reminisce about his time spent with the Benzini Brothers circus.As a runaway college student, after the death of his parents, he finds himself hopping a train that turns out to be part of the circus train.  There, instead of being thrown off, he is taken in by an older man named Camel who secures him a job with the circus mucking stalls, which later turns into a position as the circus's veterinarian.He falls in love with Marlena, the wife of his schizophrenic boss August.  While he keeps his love hidden, August, dangerous and unpredictable makes life tough for Jacob in the circus while in his better moments is a best friend to him.He also makes the acquaintance of Walter, a dwarf clown whom he bunks with and together they help Camel in his time of need.  He also makes an unlikely friend in Rosie, an elephant picked up from another failing circus whom he feels a bond with and devastation at her treatment from the cruel August.Throughout the book it cuts back and forth from Jacob at the nursing home, to his reminisces of the circus and its happenings.  One of the ending chapters recaps the prologue, only with more detail.Gruen does such a marvelous job on this book that you would believe she had traveled with a circus.  But she hadn't, all her knowledge came form extensive research and interviews.  The result is this novel, gritty and real and it keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen.  Jacob's tale is one I could read over and over again.  By far this turned out to be one of my favorite books.

Quite simply, I found Water for Elephants an exceptional read and one that any reader should not miss.

There are flashbacks reverting back to the nursing home of the present-day, where Jacob is finding his aged infirmity unbearable, but somehow this only adds to the depth of the story.Sara Gruen has created a circus world that's believable; one that you feel right in the midst of and this is carried through with her characters.  Uncle Al, (the circus boss) and August, (the animal trainer) are characters you'll hate. Whereas Marlena, Kinko the Dwarf, and Camel are character's you'll love. Chief protagonist is Jacob Jankowski and I found myself completely empathising with him. His struggle to fit into circus life, gain acceptance from his peers and deal with the urges of his love interest, make him a hugely engaging character.I highly recommend this book. It's a gripping story and is one of those novels which will both shock and thrill you. The stark poverty of the early nineteen hundreds is interspersed with details of the emotional deprivation the main character, Jacob experiences in a nursing home during his latter years. Yet in both settings a light is shone on acts of kindness which define our humanity and reinforce the fragile dignity of those who are almost overwhelmed by their plights. There is a social history dimension to the story which enhances its value and impact. This is easily one of the better books I've ever read.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "When the Circus Came to Town", "unixReviewTime": 1374364800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2013"}

Gruen really fleshes out the characters in this book. And what I especially enjoy is the strong sense of time and place she evokes, she recreates a real slice of Americana. Water for Elephants is set during the Depression, a time long before I was born. I feel as if I much better understand what life was like for Americans during this period, and the importance circuses played in providing some escape from people's otherwise desperate lives. And I feel as if I glimpsed what life is really like in a circus, behind the facade of magic and glamour. I heartily recommend this novel to anyone wanting a compelling read, even though there were some aspects of the plot that I could see coming from a long way off. The real photographs from Depression-era circuses included at the beginning of each chapter was a nice touch, as was the striking cover art.

He decides to hop a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  The Great Depression was just in its early stages so for Jacob having a paying job was lucky but he also found parts of the circus life to be a living hell.  As he was just shy of his degree, Jacob ends up being put in charge of the menagerie, the starring animals of the show.He then meets Marlena, the beautiful equestrian act star who happens to be married to August, the twisted and manipulative animal trainer for the show.Uncle Al, the big boss of the Benzini Brothers, makes a habit of visiting other circus shows that fold and go under.  There he has his pick of their performers and animals.  It is at one such place that he picks up Rose, an untrainable elephant.  He hopes her to be the savior of this traveling show that struggles a bit to keep up with Ringling Brothers, the top of the line.  Jacob finds an instant connection with Rosie and the show and his life start to change.The book alternates between Jacobs time with the circus and his \"present\" time where he is 90 (\"or maybe 93\"...as he can't quite remember) and in an assisted living home.  A circus has come to town and is visible out of the windows of the home.  No one knows Jacobs past at the home when a new resident comes along and claims he carried water for the elephants in the circus when he was younger.  This kind of woos the ladies and makes Jacob (who is much the curmudgeon by this time in his life) very upset and sets off a string of trouble for him at the home.The prologue when read at the beginning of the book very much drew me in to the story.  When the same story makes its appearance toward the end of the book it is amazingly powerful.  You'll just have to read it for yourself to truly see what I'm talking about.You can really tell that the author has a love of the circus and has done her research to bring the most accuracy she can to this tale.

Why did he join the circus in the first place? Not once did he mention missing his dead parents, his home, school etc. Didn't he have any memories from his childhood, no worries about the future, no relatives, no friends? You never knew what he was about to do next, because his motives, thoughts and emotions were never dealt with, and that's probably because the writer had absolutely no idea how to do that properly.3) I get the feeling that some people liked this book simply because it was so easy to read even Bobo the monkey would get it, since it lacked any depth or complication in the script or the characters. Readers who rate this kind of books with 5 stars have obviously no idea what real literature is.4) The dialogue was poor, and so blatantly contemporary that it made me angry at the writer's lazyness of doing her research properly.5) It was so obvious that the writer was a woman that you could not get it out of your mind even for a minute.6) I'm no prude, but I'm sure images of the masturbating dwarf will be haunting me for a long time.7) Trust a good old disaster/great accident to get rid of the bad guys for you. That way you don't get to kill them yourself and become (gasp!) a bad guy yourself. I would be curious to see how the main character would get out of all that mess if the stampede had not happened.8) If you owned a circus and half a brain, would you hire a 90 year old cripple whith serious health problems who ran away from a nursing home and whom you have just met? Yeah, I didn't think so.9) I can't really recall the sex scenes, which means they we probably not as graphic as some readers suggest, and as for the animal cruelty parts of the novel, yes, they were (theoretically) gruesome but failed to disturb me or make a real impression on me because they were simply not convincing or believable, as was the rest of the book.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "reads like a script from a bad Disney movie", "unixReviewTime": 1276560000, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2010"}

As a young vet student at Cornell, Jacob is just about to sit for his final exams when both of his parents are killed in a car wreck. Sorting through their affairs, Jacob discovers that his family was penniless, having mortgaged their home to pay for his Ivy-league education.Sick with grief, Jacob hops a train. A train, he discovers, that is carrying the Benzini Brothers traveling circus. Before he knows it, he's on staff as the circus vet, tending to the needs of the circus lions, chimpanzees, and other fauna. It doesn't take Jacob long to meet Marlena, the beautiful performer in charge of the trick horses, and he's instantly smitten. However, Marlena's not free; she's already married to August, a bipolar, abusive manager in the traveling outfit. (Hence the requisite love triangle.)The rest of the tale follows Jacob as he discovers Rosie, a talented performing elephant; finds his own voice; siezes true love; and makes his way in the world.This is a great book.

Quite honestly, the goodreads synopses does the book no justice because what this book is-is no less than amazing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine happens to be that this is one of my all time favorite books. My compairison to the movie almost ruined the book for me, but I'm glad that I was able to get past it.The beginning of the book is very misleading, and it really made me dislike Marlena, the leading lady of this books. It is Marlena who begins an affair with Jacob, our hero, only they don't sleep together until its already been assumed by other people that they were indeed together. I did not like her one bit until the end.One of the most charming aspects of this book is how it flips between young Jacob as he works on the circus with the animals and then back again to him, 90 or 93 (he's not quite sure). I thought that the switch between the two worlds is great because on one side you see this young man who has his whole life ahead of him and then you see where he is today.I loved when he talked about the animals and how he took care of them. Once he mentioned that he was a vet student, you can tell that he is going to work in the capacity of vet to the animals. I hated how the animals were mistreated by August, especially Rosie, who was the lovable elephant. Although Rosie seems stupid, she proves to be a lot smarter than anyone thought.Most of the characters have redeeming qualities that, although they are rough around the edges, you can't help but feel for them. Walter and Camel, Jacob's two bunkmates are no exception to that characterization. Walter- a midget clown and his dog Queenie, are very mean at the start until a prank makes Water soften up on the new guy. Camel was the one that helped to get Jacob a job on the circus to begin with.What made the book for me was also the ending, and although you can interpret it two ways, I chose to see it as an old man who isn't ready to settle down into a nursing home and so instead he moves forward with his life on board with another circus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A new favorite", "unixReviewTime": 1346544000, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2012"}

I understood that, while the story was fiction, the author did some research and incorporated several real-life incidents. So, based on this, I actually crossed the threshold of a physical Barnes & Noble, picked \"Water for Elephants\" off a wooden shelf, and presented my plastic card to a human cashier. For all this effort, I truly hoped the novel would be superb. In some ways, it was.  But overall, no.\"Water for Elephants\" is the story of the struggling Benzini Brothers circus, for which the main character and narrator, Jacob Jankowski, works as a veterinarian. Jacob falls in love with Marlena, a kind and beautiful performer. Unfortunately, Marlena is married to the violently temperamental animal trainer, August. When the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob and Marlena struggle together to defend the sweet pachyderm against August's rages. The story divulges the slimy underbelly of circus life, including gross mistreatment of both human workers and animals, right up to the stunning climax when Marlena ends August's reign of terror.Gruen alternates the novel's setting between a contemporary nursing home where 93-year-old Jacob now lives in a state of semi-dementia, and the 1931 traveling circus. In the nursing home, as Jacob waits for his family to escort him to a modern circus, he wafts in and out of lucidity and mentally revisits his old Benzini Brothers days. Although the flashback technique feels a little worn and, in Gruen's hands, contrived, it does set up a finely constructed and sentimental ending, which is one of the novel's strengths.Aside from the tender conclusion, the story itself has other redeeming qualities. The plot is engaging enough to keep you reading, especially as it nears the climax. Also, Gruen exposes the abuses that occurred in depression-era circuses and, which I fear, probably still exist to some extent. Several scenes are emotionally excruciating, but responsible consumers should be aware of ugly realities.Unfortunately, \"Water for Elephants\" also disappoints.  First, the characters are shallowly constructed. I didn't walk away with a lasting identification with any of them, and in fact, by the time I wrote this post, I had to look up all of their names. Also, Gruen's writing style is flat and unmemorable. While the premise was promising, her blas&eacute; rendering diminished what might have been a great novel in the hands of a more skilled wordsmith.If you care about animals, you want a good story, and you're not a finicky reader, then step right up! \"Water for Elephants\" will entertain and amaze, and it may even spur you to reconsider your attitude toward traveling animal shows. But if you're hungry for something profound and beautiful, then move along, folks.

The pace of the plot and the use of flashbacks work very well and speed things smoothly along.  The sensitivity between nursing home resident Jacob and favorite nurse Rosemary is beautifully portrayed, and Jacob's observations in the nursing home seem right on target.Minuses: (1) Not enough solid background research into the psyche of the lead character (Jacob) as an almost-veterinarian (moreover, he is also son of a veterinarian).  There were passages where his feelings for and about animals were almost entirely ignored.  In general, there would have been more solid creativity if the author had explored and deepened the relationship of the vet with the animals.  I was expecting Jacob to develop a very deep understanding of at least the elephant, leading to a very strong bond, etc.  He goes through the motions, but I never believe he really understands the elephant, and this is one of the most important parts of the story.(2) Conversely, too much attention is given the run-of-the-mill sexual awakening and human love story of the main character.  I don't mind that it's part of the novel, but I was expecting a deep, enchanting bond between human and animals, which would set the novel apart from the ho-hum.  For me, this borders on a Romance Novel, and should be advertised as such.(3) There was just barely enough information about the circus to hold the story up, and there could have been richer texture by beefing up the details about circus life.Summary: If you happen to have read Waller's -The Bridges of Madison County-(another book that caused a big stir, even though it was basically a romance novel), as well as a perfect gem of a book called -Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe- (Fannie Flagg's masterpiece that was almost as good on film) and if you've read Berger's -Little Big Man- one of the most creative uses of the flashbacks of an very aged man (not so good on film)...put these 3 together and you can imagine what -Water for Elephants- is like.Better yet, if you haven't read Fried Green Tomatoes or Little Big Man, GO READ THOSE INSTEAD of Water for Elephants.

'Carnival' and 'Water for Elephants' only common thread is that take place in the same time in history and based on traveling entertainers (not even the same type of traveling groups).My big regret is not finishing the book before they announced the movie and who was playing the characters - but that's not the books fault.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not like Carival...

This is one rare occasion where I loved the movie more than the book (but that may just be because I saw the movie first.) In some ways this is like an amped up romance novel. There's so much focus on the romance between Jacob and Marlena but she has the personality of a wet napkin so I really don't get the appeal. When I read the negative reviews for this book a lot of people made issue with the \" graphic and frequent sex scenes\" it made me somewhat hesitant to read it but those concerns were unfounded. There was some sex, and some thoughts of sex and some lit nips BUT the story is being told by a sex-deprived geriatric/ a horny teenage VIRGIN! If anyone was shocked that a 19yo was obsessed with scoring a little trim they should walk directly off the nearest cliff. It was a bit more detail than necessary but I've read sex scenes that made me cringe from the details and this wasn't that. If I had to list my own personal complaints I would start with the ending, that was literally my biggest issue with this novel. There are some big, gaping, elephant sized holes my friends. I mean, what did they do, stand around Bumpuckey West Nowhereland with 12 horses and and elephant for however many days until Ringling could come pick them up? I mean I get that it was a happy ending, the sun will come out tomorrow etc. but the author basically did a Sopranos style fade to black. What about the other animals?! Whatever, don't get me started, I could go off on an all day tangent.... point is there was something to be desired. My favorite parts of the book were mostly centered around Old Jacob, he was by far the best written (and my favorite) character. Curious as to why they cut the Rosemary character out of the movie, because their relationship was a nice really sweet.

Love between a man and a woman; love between humans and animals; and people's love of circuses. All these sub-stories coalesce into one that is set at the time of the Great Depression to make up the background of this book.The book starts with a horrendous scene in which the circus's animals stampede and a murder takes place. A man's head is split open by a big stake. The next chapter is in the nursing home where we get to meet a 90+ year old man named Jacob who is in a nursing home. Jacob is lucid and his mind is still sharp and he comments on the other residents of the nursing home who are much further along the path of dementia and senility. The rest of the book bounces around between Jacob in the nursing home, and Jacob as the brand-new minted veterinarian.Putting the story in a time line, Jacob is about set to graduate from the Cornell Veterinary School when a tragic accident kills his parents. He is an only child and it turns out that his parents took all of their savings and a mortgage out on their house to be able to afford to send him to Cornell. When they die, there is nothing left for him so he returns to Cornell to sit for his final exams. His mind is not on schooling and he ends up leaving the school and wanders down the road. It's not long before he decides to hop on a train that is travelling by and this gets him introduced into the world of the circus as it just happens to be a circus train that he jumps on.Being the time of the Great Depression, there is a chance that he will get thrown directly off the train as a hobo but he manages to make some friends among the crowd of laborers and they get him accepted as another laborer on the circus until it is discovered that he is almost a veterinarian. For the circus owner, that is close enough and Jacob is now the circus's vet. Now he moves up in the world and is allowed to travel in a train car with performers and meets the love of his life amongst them. He also meets up with animals that he treats with empathy and kindness - and they respond with friendship.He also meets with some of the more zany and crazy people who inhabit that world and none of them are necessarily nice. There is a crazy horse trainer; violent security men; \"patch men\" who clean up the inevitable problems and messes that take place; and, of course, the associated laborers and hangers-on who populate the world. Jacob deals with them all in his own way and the story develops in a relatively predictable manner. It is no surprise that the animals respond to Jacob's kindness in kind and find ways to get back at the people who treat them badly. There are numerous anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book culled from the rich history of the circus world - things like the Lemonade Thief; the Animal who only understands Polish; and the less than legal activities that surrounded the circus.The climax of the story is presented in the first chapter - the murder. There is no real mystery there - we know who will get murdered right after the first meeting with the man. What is left in doubt is who did the killing. That is resolved in a very satisfying way at the end of the book.However, there is another storyline here too. The old Jacob finds out that a circus is coming to perform outside his nursing home and he would dearly like to go back to the world that he left 60-odd years before - if only for a visit. But, wouldn't you know it - that happens to be the week that his family forgets to come visit him in the nursing home. The twist that the author puts in at this point is brilliant and brings the whole book to a double satisfying ending which proves that once you are involved in a world that you really like, you never really leave it.This was overall a very fun book to read. Being an animal lover, I really appreciated the insights into the world of the exotic - and not so exotic - animals provided. Of course, the whole glimpse into the world of circus life was also interesting. About the only negative thing I have to say about the book is its almost obsessive fascination with human sexuality. There is almost no single chapter that does not have a sex scene in it and it is not clear to me how most of them contribute to the overall story line. In other words, I would not give this story to your younger children to read, but, aside from that one quibble, this is a good read.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "True loves can be found in the circus", "unixReviewTime": 1221264000, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2008"}

But I will always give a book a try.  I picked it up and the prologue had a pretty decent umph to it.  The plot, a cornell student in his senior year, loses his parents and joins the circus in a fit of anger and disbelief, is told to the reader soon after the book starts.  The rest of the book is told through the eyes of the boy, Jacob as a young man in the circus and simultaneously as an old man in a home.The story is a bit strange, yet it works.  I have to admit that some of the character development was not great but it seems that mysterious part of the story was intentional.  The book is about Jacob, and his experiences.  The other characters were just there to help us understand this man.The part of the book I thought I would like the least, animals, I tended to enjoy quite often.  And Sara's soft writing style but quick with the action kept me on the edge of my seat.  As soon as I thought the story was taking a long, boring, un-necessary mistep to fill empty book pages, she surprised me with another turn in the story.  I enjoyed her writing style.  She had a story to tell, and she told it.  She didn't bore us with endless details of animal cages, circus scenes, or odd scenic descriptions.  In fact, ironically, I found myself wanting a little more time with some of the animals.  At the end of the book I thought maybe she could have wrote a few more in-depth scenes with jacob interacting with the animals.  But like I said, this is a story about a boys emotional journey through a very difficult time in his life.  The animals and the other characters in the book just provided a backdrop and an interesting environment.Note:  Although, I see the book as a book about Jacob, Sara was inspired to write this novel after reading an article about the Circus.  She then spent some time researching the circus and animals intending to write a story about the circus.  Interestingly enough, maybe she wrote a story about the circus and Jacob is just the human backdrop!  I do highly recommend this book.

This book is a true winner; one that I will think about for years to come.The author spent much time researching circus life in the 20's and 30's and it shows.  The book had such vivid characters and the story line was fast-paced and so, so interesting.  The blending of fact and fiction is expertly done!!!  Having never really been interested in circus life, I found things out that were surprising and shocking!  Life with the circus was a rough, tough, hard, shocking life that was full of strict rules and social status.  However, these rules changed on the whims of the owners/operators and changed many fates for the worse.  The original black and white photos included throughout the book add to the total top quality of this great read.The main character, Jacob, narrates his life story at the age of 90-something.  While the story-line jumps from present to past, it is easy to follow and never confusing.The characters are wonderful and you will find yourself so caught up in the plot of this book. I could not turn the pages fast enough. I guarantee you will laugh, cry, and be shocked when you are finished reading this great read.

I loved the book so much I'm try not to let myself give too much away!**My Description:Water for Elephants is a novel bringing us back to the world of the traveling circus in the early 1900&#8242;s when they traveled by train.  Jacob Jankowski is a young man in his early 20&#8242;s with dreams of becoming a veterinarian like his father.  Very close to the final day for his testing to become licensed his parents die in a car accident and his entire life changes.  Running away from his problems he ends up jumping on a train and this one-act takes him on the ride of his life.  Jacob becomes a worker for a traveling circus as their very own vet and in the process falls in love with Marlena, one of the shows acts.  The problem, she's a married woman.  Along their travels the circus owner buys an Elephant, Rosie, in hopes to become the greatest act in all the history of circuses...Water for Elephants is a magical book! It brought me back to when I was a child dreaming of being a circus performer.  The way Gruen describes the circus and it's acts really paints a picture in your mind and you feel like you are right there with Jacob the entire time.  I loved how Gruen cuts back and forth between Jacob as an elderly man in a home remembering when he was on a circus to when Jacob was in his early 20&#8242;s on the circus.  You love Jacob in both ages, especially as a  feisty elderly man! I love when Gruen brought Jacob in as an elderly man, he brings in some comedy as well as makes you understand how some elderly people feel when they are in a nursing home.Gruen knows how to writer her characters.  You fall in love with so many of them!  Walter, Jacob's roommate on the train. Camel, the man who takes Jacob in under his wing when Jacob first jumps on the train.  The lovely Marlena, Jacobs love interest.  Rosie, the beautiful 53-year-old-elephant.  You also don't like some of the characters like Uncle Al, the circus owner, and August, Marlena's husband.  Trust me, there are times you just want to jump through the book and beat them yourselves!I absolutely fell in love with this book.  I had two of my good friends telling me that I must read it because it was just that good and I was not disappointed.  I do believe that anyone who has an interest in any genre would love this book!  It's a very fast read and you don't want to put it down. Again, it's just magical! It leaves you smiling and happy.  This book will be on my bookshelf forever and will be picked up several times for a reread! :-DOh, you can buy the Kindle version of this book for just a little over $4.00 but from what I've heard you don't get the awesome circus pictures throughout the book.  Gruen places a real circus picture at the beginning of each chapter that is from when Jacob is in his 20&#8242;s on the circus.  It's awesome! There is only one chapter that didn't have a circus pic infront of it when it should have, :-( but really they are great.  If you buy the kindle version, the next time you're in the bookstore pick up the paperback version and flip through and check out the pictures at least...they're fun!  :-D", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "6/5 Stars!

Bunkel, known as Uncle Al, who is described as \"a buzzard, a vulture, an eater of carrion,\" who grew fat off the carcasses of circusses that collapsed after the Crash. Their losses were his gains.  The Prologue introduces the narrative which begins with a stampede of circus animals, and we are introduced to a secret which is kept by the narrator for 70 years.  The reader is immediately pulled into the narrative.The narrative is juxtaposed between Jacob Jankowski's life during the seven years he spent in the circus and his present life as an irascible 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) year old man in an assisted living facility.  As a young  veterinary student about to graduate from Cornell, Jacob finds himself homeless and parentless and is unable to take his final exams.  He finds himself jumping on a train which turns out to be Benzini's Circus train.  The reader is introduced to circus lingo - rubes are the circus-goers, kinkers are the performers and Patches are the men assigned to smooth the ruffled feathers of disgruntled spectators who might be angry they didn't get their money's worth at the Freak Show or those of a homeowner whose garden has been destroyed by a wandering elephant. One is given a glimpse into the highly stratified, almost caste-like social world of the circus in which performers never rubbed elbows with the likes of the lowly workers, particulary the black workers of the Flying Squadron, who were instructed to run into their tents and remain invisible as soon as the rubes started to make their appearance.The novel is plot-driven, and although there are many stereotypical elements - there are the requisite evil villains - Uncle Al and his sidekick August Rosenbluth, the equestrian director and superintendent of animals who is hated and feared for his violent tendencies and his legendary cruelty to humans and circus animals. There is also the requisite central love story between two gentle souls sho have been dealt life's difficult blows, but whose goodness and pure intentions help them to weather the storm. There is Bobo the orangutuan and particularly Rosie the elephant, who steal our hearts, and we root for them as much as we root for Jacob and Marlena. If you are looking for a novel embedded with deep hidden meanings and rich with literary technique and complex characterization, then this is definitely not the book for you. If you are looking for a plot-driven novel whose events proceed rapidly and which transports the reader to another world, then I highly recommend this delightfully readable novel.In spite of the stereotypical elements, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I found myself getting up extra early and staying up extra late to get to the last page, and when I did, I was sorry the journey was over. I wasn't quite ready to say goodbye to Jacob, Marlena, Kinko, Camel, Rosie or Bobo.

The circus train theme is interesting and fun to read, and this is what keeps the book going. One scene near the end depicted the main characters in a church; I thought this would be developed further. It turns out this was just added in to try to show the morality of Jacob, perhaps to foreshadow that he could never kill Marlena's husband August. Jacob started out at the beginning of the book as a naive innocent kid. How he could change into such an experienced risk-taker in a period of just a few months confused me. He certainly doesn't seem the church-going type by the end of the novel.

Unfortunately for Jacob (our star) it was not his dream to join the circus, but rather coincidence mixed with his last hope. The story is told from two viewpoints: Jacob is now ninety-something years old and we see what has become of our young protagonist, and we see many flashback sequences to the events that took place as he traveled with the circus.As readers we are exposed to the sharp contrast between his youth and aged eras. With the circus, Jacob's life was so full of adventure and non-stop activity. Now he is resident in an assisted-living facility and he fears he is losing his energy and becoming more and more like the peers with whom he shares lodging. As he relives the excitement of his days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth he not only longs for a different time, but resets his grip on his past. He is one old man who is not ready to give up on life.Sara Gruen gave us a beautiful story about a man who refuses to let go of the events that changed his life. As you read about Jacob your heart will break and then, if possible, it will break again. It is much more than one young man's tale of woe, however. The story is one of love, hope, never giving up and some unlikely good friends. You will laugh, worry, delight and cheer with Jacob whether he is twenty something or ninety something. I really appreciate that the author went the extra mile in her research of life in the circus.I didn't think I would like Water for Elephants, but I heard from too many people that it was good.

She uses structure, plot, and setting with originality.  She employs literary devices in innovative ways.  Her characters are believable even though they inhabit the unreal world of the circus.First, structure and plot.  Gruen describes the ending of the novel in the prologue.  She infuses the prologue with ambiguity so the reader cannot be clear about what happened.  She structures the rest of the book as a search for answers to the perplexing prologue.Second, innovative literary devices.  Gruen withholds information like a magician.  This device (suspense) allows her to keep the reader engaged, and befuddled. The novel reads like the children's storytelling game where the narrator brings a character to an impossible situation then hands the storytelling over to the next person.  Each chapter has a rise and fall.Another literary device Gruen handles creatively is point of view.  The story, told in first person, is seen through the consciousness of Jacob Jankowski.  But Jacob's point of view is complicated because it alternates between Jacob in his twenties, and Jacob in his nineties.  So the reader sees two viewpoints depending upon which stage of life Jacob narrates his story from.Finally setting and characters.  Gruen's setting and characters are unusual.  The background is Midwestern, and depression-era.  The culture is the circus (Benzini's not-quite-as-good-as-Ringling-Bros Circus).  The characters are performers, entertainers, workers, and animals that perform, eat, sleep, travel, love, hate, fight, and care for each other with a common goal: to produce a show.  Though the setting and characters are specific, the reader can relate to them because they display the same passions and vulnerability we all do.  Gruen transcends specificity and finds universal connections.  Life is performing in the Big Top.  We are all players.  We struggle with good and evil, kindness and cruelty, pleasure and suffering, life and death.  The show goes on.

After failing to complete veterinary school, he ends up working on a traveling circus, going to town after town with the big top acts, the freak shows, and the menagerie of exotic animals.  He quickly learns that there is a darker side to the circus behind the scenes that the happy, popcorn eating crown never sees.The set up workers are considered expendable and are kicked off the train if they stay on past their usefulness, and animals are often treated cruelly and ruthlessly.  Out of necessity, sometimes life was cruel during the Great Depression, but sleazy ringmaster Uncle Al and violent animal trainer August Rosenbluth choose to perpetrate this unnecessarily at the Benzini Brothers circus.  Jacob remains part of this world as he is tied by love and duty to the animals in his care, as well as his friends and the beautiful Marlena, wife of August.This was not always an easy book to read.  There are graphic scenes of animal cruelty that had me wincing, as well as heartbreaking scenes of human disappointments and pain.  Despite this, I recommend this novel wholeheartedly.

What I found was a story that hooked me.I was so terrified to read about any animal cruely, and to be truthful there is some of that in this book. However, I found myself not able to put it down.The story was more about someone who had chosen a path in life, and then when a devestating act occurs  changes that path to something totally differently.I think the whole lesson of the book is that life may be taking us one way, and then one little moment can change everything. That changed moment can even make us think that what we wanted was not what we really wanted after all.As for the animal cruelty, while I hate it, I had to say that it really did occur and probably still does occur in some circuses. Very hard for me to stomach, but at least the author put the truth in the book.I am not going to summarize the book. All I can really say is pick it up and give it a try. A definite entertainment.

As I mentioned above, the book didn't really live up to the hype for me. And the love story was just okay. It wasn't particularly passionate or compelling - I would call it \"love story lite\". I would actually describe the whole book as \"lite\". It ended exactly how I expected to end. There were no twists, nothing unexpected, and it just didn't have much depth. Which is really disappointing because the setting was great. A circus, traveling through the U.S. by train, during the Great Depression, with hundreds of employees and a whole menagerie of animals, including the titular elephant, provides so much potential for an interesting story. Unfortunately, the author didn't put this great source material to the best use.Don't get me wrong - I finished the book and finished it pretty quickly. It was a fast read and there were some good characters, but I just wanted more. More detail, more passion, more depth. Water for Elephants just didn't go far enough for me.In a nutshell: Just okay. Water for Elephants would make a decent beach read, but it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.

{"reviewerID": "A2ZANBU159WYZA", "asin": "0002007770", "reviewerName": "Raithe", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "I found Sara Gruen's WATER FOR ELEPHANTS thoroughly enchanting in a very engrossing tale of the 1930s traveling circus Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Part wonder, part adventure, part tragedy and turmoil, and part romance, my first Gruen novel conveys a novel artistry in the settings, characters, prose and storytelling that resonated. Similar to another I read recently (Cornwell's rendition of Arthur), we find a popular style of writing I find many authors choosing as of late: a first-person narration that shifts from a flashback when he's 23 years old and to the present tense when he's 90... or 93. The flashback comprises the bulk of the book's content over the span of 3 to 4 months when 23 year-old Jacob lands in a shady traveling circus amidst the historical backdrop of the Great Depression and the prohibition of alcohol. Normally, first-person flashbacks tend to affect a doleful disposition. Not so here. Remarkably, I found the present happenings of our senile 90-or-93 year-old Jacob in a nursing home refreshingly funny and instructively captivating as we laugh and empathize with Jacob. I'll never look at my grandmother the same way again. In fact the book derives its title from a grumpy Jacob grousing over another old man claiming to bring water for elephants in his younger days.Personal wants and simple plot devices prevented a perfect 5-star rating on my part. I'm impressed by Gruen's research into the time period and traveling circuses, and admittedly, Gruen's hypnotizing writing style, symmetric storytelling and gritty characterizations far surpasses many of my 4 and 5-star books. I read a 553-page large print edition of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS containing black-and-white photos of 1930s circuses and for the 100 to 200 pages, I was enthralled. The wonder and the adventure of it had me smiling and on the edge of my seat. The book then settles down with the August-Rosenbluth character who factors in more and more prominently. Much of the plotting deals with August, his wife Marlena and our protagonist Jacob as the third wheel at a private dinner or outing. August's violent schizophrenia took center stage and the August character and his prominence choked much of my enthusiasm. Instead of August, I was hoping for more wonders of the circus, more Camel, Walter, and more plots with the animals of the menagerie. The caste-like, hierarchal circus society consisting of performers, workers and rubes was very interesting, but Jacob's helplessness within that hierarchy, although gritty and realistic, proved altogether exasperating. I was hoping to see Jacob doing more, whether helping the elephant or protecting Marlena (both from August). I also found the ending a bit disappointing and anticlimactic, I wanted to see at least one more chapter of closure in the flashback rather than relaying the aftermath in the present tense.At its heart, the book expresses Jacob's story of love -- an impossible love for his wife, a love for animals and the elephant, and of course, a love for the wondrous circus. Unlike so many potboiler romance novels, here's a love between a man and woman that isn't so trite: we have a sexually-inexperienced, red-haired 23 year-old college boy and the compassionate star of the circus who dares to love him, and in return, warrants his affection, caring, loyalty and love. Even though their first love scene isn't ideal by romance standards, it nevertheless reverberates with passion and we witness Jacob's joy for giving as she guides him. Granted, it's written entirely from Jacob's perspective and even though the first lovemaking wasn't scientifically precise (again, by romance standards), the book captures how each gives their heart for the other. Everything isn't initiated by Jacob and that in itself was noteworthy. For myself, love is about mutual giving, and I always hope to see some semblance of that. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS doesn't disappoint.I'm astonished to read a very believable and resonating account of a male character written by a woman. In spite of Jacob's frustrating helplessness at times, I loved how realistic, how passionate and how intense he was about the animals, friends and love he cares for. I appreciated Jacob's passion and intensity minus the inane, repetitious introspection so common to the romance genre. No, guys don't think and muse about things for endless pages, and Gruen thankfully discarded that element of the romance. Things are happening anyway, so Gruen need not fill the pages with cheap introspection.The story actually begins with the ending. It was actually deftly done, and Gruen fills in the details when we encounter the prologue at the very end of the book again. Ironically, this added a measure of suspense to the novel.  As I mentioned before, I thought the book limped to its conclusion. I would have appreciated another chapter in the flashback depicting our protagonists in a new act with another circus.Still, I found the reading experience a captivating novelty to say the least.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A joy to read", "unixReviewTime": 1195430400, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2007"}

A friend sent this to me and I finally found the time to read it (plus it was also a group read). The book definitely does live up to its reputation, and I will most likely list it as one of my favorite reads in 2008.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of a man, who now in his golden years, is reminiscing about his past and his days with a traveling circus. The book goes back and forth between the two time periods, the present and the past (Depression era), and I think it was done quite nicely. Jacob Jankowski is the narrator and old man that is looking back on the eccentric life he had with the circus, about the people he met and knew, and the woman that changed his life. While Jacob sits in the old folks home, his mind wanders back to those days, often confusing the present with the past.His past takes us to his story of how he ended up with the circus, just a few college exams short of a degree. His future was to be that of a veterinarian, but that dream was cut short when his parents die suddenly, and he doesn't have the focus to continue. He loses the family home, loses his bright future, and has nowhere to go. Luck brings him to the train that carries the circus from one town to another. He hitches a ride, and thus begins the adventure of a lifetime.The reader will discover that this book is not really about the circus. Yes, most of the story line does take place behind the scenes of a circus, but what WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is really all about is loyalty, friendship and love, and the relationships that Jacob develops during these years with the circus. Comparing Jacob's current life in the seniors' home to what he had in the circus is almost akin to that of a caged animal being locked up. Jacob's time in this seniors' home is stagnating him, and he continues to look back at his younger years with longing. He remembers all that had transpired, his relationships with his fellow circus entertainers and workers, the circus ringmaster, a cruel and dangerous man who had his gentle side, and the ringmaster's wife, Marlena, who is in a way imprisoned in a marriage that she can't get out of.  In the middle of it all is a gentle elephant named Rosie, who becomes an integral part of the circus and an animal that Jacob takes under his wing. It is Rosie's relationship with several of the main characters that helps tell the story of these people, leading back toJacob's present state and where his last remaining days on earth will take him.I highly recommend WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. It's an insightful story about people, in an unusual setting.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wonderful story!", "unixReviewTime": 1210809600, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2008"}

The book is told both in the present and in 1931 by Jacob Jankowski. We start with him in an old folk's home, where he tells us he's either 90 or 93. He's past caring at this point about pretty much anything. Then one day he sees a bunch of the other patients gathered at one of the windows. He goes over to see what they are all looking at and finds that the circus is in town, and within throwing distance of his geriatric home.The appearance of the circus brings back memories of his first experience with the circus, which began just as he was finishing his veterinarian degree at Cornell University. He goes through a tragic time and leaves in the middle of his final exams, walking until his legs get tired. Where his legs led him was to the town's railroad tracks. He jumps on the next passing train, although it's late at night and he's not sure what type of train he's just hitched. In the morning he finds that it's a circus train and he's taken on as the circus veterinarian.The book then goes through his time on the circus, his interactions with the beautiful Marlena and her abusive husband, August. Not only does August treat Marlena badly, but he abuses the animals, especially Rosie, the Polish-speaking elephant taken on by Uncle Al, the circus ringleader.I know not all people are huge fans of circuses, but if you can stomach it I highly suggest you read this book. It's obvious from her writing that Gruen has a soft spot for the circus and this time period. She wrote about it in a lovely way, without being too easy on the circus operators. She showed the dark side of the circus (beating animals, low pay, difference between working men and performers, etc.) without overdoing it.

He now is without a family and a home.

It all gets ugly as his boss reveals physiological problems resulting in death at times.

The loneliness of the assisted living is shown with deep emotion, and the dirty side of the glamorous circus is laid out before the reader.This is one of those books that you'll either love or hate. It is not action packed. Most of the action does not occur till very late in the book. The majority of the story is slow as it goes through many of the mental thoughts of Jacob and the detailed life of a circus performer and worker. I found it easy to put down and resume reading at a later time. But I am very glad I read it. It is a good read, but a read that only those that prefer slower, deep readings can enjoy.There is graphic language and scenes that might be offensive to some though they are not many. It is not a pretty story as the life of the circus was hard and dirty. This story depicts a seedy side of the glamor.Ms. Gruen did a great job bringing to life interesting characters that won't soon be forgotten.Note: This book was borrowed by me from the library.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Glad I Read It", "unixReviewTime": 1334188800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2012"}

It turned out to be a very well written and beautiful story about love, hardships, and a circus. It's the great depression 1932, prohibition is in full swing, and like so many others a young man has had his entire life torn into pieces and ends up wandering straight into the adventure of a lifetime.  Jake Jankowski, the main character in our epic story, is distraught when he is informed that both his parents have died in an automobile accident. After, what we can only assume is a nervous breakdown while taking his final exams for veterinary school; he walks out and continues until he cannot bear to go any further.  While resting near a train track as a train rumbles up, and he decides to try to \"hitch\" a ride to the next town not realizing he has jumped aboard a circus train.  From there he meets many characters who will forever change his life.I found myself falling in love right along with him, hating the villain with a fiery passion, and cheering for a quirky elephant named Rosie whom Sara Gruen describes so vividly that you can't help but smile.  Sara Gruen manages to create a scene so well you can imagine yourself there, but she never loses you with too many details.  Personally, I am torn whether or not I love this story.  In the first half of the book when she is setting a scene she would add some explicit details that weren't necessary. Since she had already masterfully created her setting and by adding those I can only assume she was after shock value.  I did enjoy the story, but I have a hard time swallowing adultery, I guess I have just been married too long.  I can understand why the characters were drawn to each other and why she would cheat on her husband, but I don't personally enjoy it.  In my opinion she could have used something else for her characters to over-come.  It's not like they didn't have three or four other obstacles to surmount.

I must admit that I appreciated the old man's story in the nursing home more than the kid on the train, but that's just me.  The one thing I noticed right off the bat is that this writer took very seriously - \"don't tell, show\" and show she does in sometimes tedious plodding, even disgusting detail.This can actually become tiresome.I was surprised because my favorite author is a \"show-er\", and I love to read her work, but maybe it's the fact that she has never written something as long as this.In anycase, I have not gone through the thousands of reviews there are, but there are over 1500 5 star reviews, and I can't help but wonder - if the protagonist was a woman, and what happened to Jacob that night he drank entriely too much had happened to her - would it not be considered a rape or sexual assault of some kind?  Has the definition changed since I was younger?  I just have a big feeling that if it was a woman who was drunk out of her mind and two overly friendly men thought they would *welcome* her to the circus at that very time in her state of no mind - it would be all hell and high water in here - not 1500 five star reviews.  I dont understand why it's different.  Is that why if a man is raped, he would rather suffer in shame than speak up?  Does he wonder who will take him serously?  Who will care?You know what else gets me?  When you take away the wordiness of this book, the premise, plot and story of young Jacob is so painfully simple it's not even funny, there is NO development of the relationship between he and Marlena.  *Spoiler Alert*  It all boils down to boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl gets beat up by her abusive husband, boy hates husband, husband gets miraculously killed - boy runs away with girl they have tons of kids and live happily ever after.  The story of the circus was quite honestly just alright I dont understand the utter praise for this book. Is it because we are shown the innerworkings of a long ago circus, is it because its ending seemed shocking?  Is it because four of the characters we get to know are sacrificed in the closing chapters?  I have no idea - something has happened in our society where things that are just \"ok\" are slapped with excellent and pushed ahead with \"mind blowing\".  The same thing happened with \"The Help\"  - I actually saw someone refer to that one as a \"classic\" - seriously?  You compare this to Frankenstein and Pride and Prejudice and Portrait of the Artist - really?If It weren't for 93 year old Jacob's nursing home story, I would not have given this book 3 stars.

Interestingly, Gruen admits that she had never been to a circus (never been to a circus???) before writing this book.  I see that as a testimony to the quality of her research and her writing.  I also love the way she integrates real stories that she has heard from circus folks with her fictional tale (all explained in the interview).Honestly, I thought the \"prologue\" was kind of a sell out.

Now of course, this type of circus is almost extinct due to the cruel treatment of both animals and those that they marketed as \"freaks\", but there's no doubt that almost as much action and adventure happened outside of the ring as inside. The \"Greatest show on earth\" was just as good a description of life on these itinerant circuses as it was to the events shown to they paying public. In the US, these great circus extravaganzas travelled by rail, and the collection of desperate workers, preening performers and animals ensured an interesting mix.Sara Gruen's tale begins with a wonderfully touching portrait of a 90-ish old man, Jacob, now left to live out his days in a nursing home. But in his youth, he was employed as a circus vet (although unqualified) and what a tale he recalls. Incidentally, the name Jacob is clearly intentional as there are a number of references on the life of the biblical Jacob from Genesis - although they are subtle and only add, rather than distract from the story.Gruen has clearly researched her subject in great depth (the addition of vintage photos from the era before each chapter that is devoted to the past is a nice touch) and there's a suggestion that at least some of the stories included either did happen or are rumoured to have happened. Just occasionally her explanations are a little clumsy, but they are needed to explain some of the terminology. But most importantly, she manages to get a sense of the faded grandeur and charged atmosphere of these great circus trains.At heart, this is a love story with a list of characters that include a grumpy dwarf, a drink-sodden old timer, a beautiful performer, a naiive vet, a mad director of animals, a toothless lion and a charismatic elephant. What's not to love?A movie is due out shortly, but although not having seen it of course, it's a fair bet there will be some Hollywood style sugar coating of this tale. The book includes both some steamy scenes as well as some gritty and potentially disturbing descriptions of animal conditions - and it's all the better for that dark side - so read the book at least before seeing the movie.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Roll up, roll up", "unixReviewTime": 1294876800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2011"}

This novel is the former.  It delves into uncharted territory by putting a story to what it means to \"run away with the circus.\"  It's an interesting and creative topic. Like a lot of mass-market \"trade\" paperbacks these days, the book is high on emotion and light on character development. It also exhibits a modern-day trend of reading more like a screenplay than a novel. Events occur seemingly scene-by-scene (it's helpful the train moves from town to town) and the story is narrated by the older version of the main character, offering up a voice-over to fill in where the dialogue is thinly written. The characters are also thin. The main character is one of the few whose past is somewhat explained (cliche alert: he experiences a tragedy then just happens to jump on a circus train speeding down the tracks).  There is very little to go on about why choices are made. For example, we are told how the characters are feeling through adjectives at the end of dialogue rather than the dialogue itself revealing what's going on in a character.

But that's not going to stop me from trying, because I have confidence and determination and I often find myself in lineups where I'm the one who appears out of line. And when weirdness and eccentricities are encouraged, it tends to work better than Miracle-Gro and direct sunlight and watering.Jacob Jankowski proves more than a little odd beneath his shirt collar. He has flashbacks to his circus days where he spent all of his time shoveling excrement and smashing watermelons and filing toenails (Rosie's) and hopping on trains and off trains and carrying knives between his teeth and chasing after married women and chasing after elephants and shoving his hand in a tiger's cage and waiting for the flag to drop and speaking Polish (most of which I didn't understand) and training elephants and speaking more Polish. But I could relate rather easily because I spend much of my time staring at white space and filling it with Times New Roman font and pretending that people actually think I'm witty and charming and wonderful when my reviews and novels are placed in avid reader's hands. Because if Jacob hadn't skipped out on one life to chase after another and I couldn't pretend I was someone else for hours at a time, the real world might close in faster than a mushroom cooked in a skillet.But I wasn't blissfully ignorant after this tale, though. Finding out many of the antidotes contained in this story were at least partially, or in some cases whole-heartedly, based on actual events with the names changed to protect the guilty proved a rather outstanding addition. Since, on occasion, I do like the prospect of getting smarter, especially when I can have fun while doing it. And this was a rather enjoyable tale with Uncle Al and Rosie and August and Marlena and Kinko and plenty of other secondary characters with full-fledged personalities who proved to be more than just a series of caricatures thrown in for good measure to make the main character look pretty and exciting and interesting.Set during a rather depressing time in our nation's history, this story wasn't the least bit depressing, although men were tossed from the train faster than shot glasses tossed back at a bar by some guy with antelopes for arms. While that might turn folks off, I was rather pleased with the thought of bubble gum and candy corn and candied apples. If I want to feel dejected and disheartened, I can find plenty of reasons to sit in a corner with my head pushing against my ankles, thank you very much. I don't need it from a vessel that I like to use as an escape hatch from the real world where fairies and wands and cooch tents and sexy sheer night gowns and six-dollar smiles and two-dollar whores can be had whenever the mood strikes.If I didn't end with more than a few words on Barbara, though, my world wouldn't be complete. She commanded center stage at the cooch tent with her foot long breasts and feminine wiles and brown nipples the size of paper plates and painted expressions, as she danced and swung her hips like a supermodel down a runway. Her happy sacks increased in width at the end and her smudged lipstick and smokin' tobacco and sexy sheer nightgown where I could literally see and hear her bare breasts slapping together. All of which resulted in a totally titillating experience from which I shall never be the same.As for this novel, it proved to be a rather entertaining escape from reality.Robert DownsAuthor of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Escape From The Real World", "unixReviewTime": 1378512000, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2013"}

Hedges", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I almost exclusively read nonfiction, with perhaps one or two novels a year thrown in for a diversion. This book was given to me and came with highest recommendations, so I started reading it on a plane trip. I am normally not especially captivated by fiction, but suffice it to say that I read the book over the course of one day because I enjoyed the characters so much. The book is told in flashbacks by a 93 year old man, and addresses his years as the vet on a circus train. I found the wraparound scenes of Jacob useful for the introduction and the wonderful conclusion, but if there was one thing I would have changed about the story it was the incessant excursions to the present sprinkled throughout the story which really don't advance the plot other than to explain some issues about senior care in an assisted living community.The book begins with a delightfully deceptive prologue, setting the reader up for a surprise at the climax. I must admit that I had my suspicions about the murder in question, but found the execution to be more skillful than I had imagined. The victim, August, is a megalomaniac with a temper and forms one point in a love triangle with the protagonists, Jacob and Marlena. The circus, run by slimy vermin \"Uncle Al\" is well fleshed out with interesting characters and terminology that Gruen incorporates flawlessly into the book. I found the character of Walter (Kinko the Clown) to be the perfect complement to play off of Jacob and their relationship was one of the most interesting parts of the novel for me.Gruen handles difficult situations well, even delving into dreams vividly, as when she relates Jacob's nightmare of struggling to get back on the train while pursued by malevolent animals (\"Behind us, a wall of badgers. In front of us, a dozen alligators.\") Her turn of phrase and tendency to sly understatement is notable throughout, and adds to the story as much by omission as by overt statements. The pivotal murder is one of the most brilliant ever concocted, and the subtlety of its telling, particularly in contrast to the version in the prologue is exquisite: the wording was changed very slightly to enlighten the reader to a plot twist that may or may not have been expected, but nonetheless was wonderfully executed. The ending of the book was likewise unexpected inasmuch as the reader is so focused on the story of Jacob in the circus, they aren't giving as much consideration to the 93 year old who is actually narrating the book.As I mentioned before, there is more narration here than is absolutely necessary (but then again I normally read technical nonfiction), and as an animal lover the cruelty to animals is appalling (even if it's fiction, and despite it being historically based) although admittedly necessary to develop the plot. I mention this as the book may not be suitable for some younger readers for this reason. I found Gruen's choice of the name Jacob, and the obvious Biblical references to Jacob found in Genesis compelling and one of the things that separates this book from most contemporary fiction.Although light reading on one level, this book also deals skillfully with difficult issues, has excellent character development, and a couple of great plot twists. Also included are interviews with the author and a set of book group discussion questions, which were not written by Gruen, and which I found contrived and dull.\"Water For Elephants\" did what a good novel is supposed to do: it captivated my interest from start to finish, and I couldn't put it down.

He is cowered by Marlena's husband all the time. He is unadventurous when it comes to sexual escapades; he is just too shy, too immature to appeal to me. Also, the love story was not developed well at all. There is no palpable attraction. Marlena is created into the damsel in distress, stuck with an abusive husband, and Jacob is thrown in to rescue her. I think this damsel in distress aspect has been over done.

It is by turns heartwarming, heartbreaking, exciting, and horrifying--with an ending that took me by surprise. I enjoy circus stories and have read several, none as good as this one (with the exception of Gus the Great). If you're old enough to remember the film The Greatest Show on Earth, this is it but without the slick DeMille romanticism. Water for Elephants is raw and realistic, one man's life in a circus and in a nursing home. There are other reviews here that give details of the plot so I won't repeat what they've said.There is a lot I loved about this book--the character of Jacob, the circus atmosphere,the story itself. It has many remarkable elements.One of the most remarkable is the nursing home part of the story. The author appears to be fairly young, several decades too young to know what it feels like to be elderly, to know you are failing physically, to be afraid you're failing mentally, to remember vividly when you were young and know you will never be young again. Yet she very convincingly shows you the heart and mind of a feisty old man. All in all, it's one of the best historical novels I have ever read. I wish I had written it.The above was the text of my original review and I stand by it. However, something vauguely bothered me about the book. Then, following a discussion I reread it and did a little research of my own. Now I know what it was. She is several years too early in her use of \"paranoid schizophrenia\". By the time the old man is TELLING the story it would be in use, but certainly was not in use at the time she has a character using the term, and this seems like insufficient, possibly sloppy research. The other thing was the slaughter of several horses by cutting their throats. Horse people I know questioned it. A horse is big and powerful and would be frightened, not likely to let it happen unless he was heavily medicated. It seems done only for the effect of the gore. A properly placed gunshot would serve and be more merciful, more logical.However, I still think it's an outstanding book, even with the flaws, and I still wish I'd written it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Brilliant but flawed", "unixReviewTime": 1211500800, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2008"}

The answer, of course, is experience, the real question being how one describes that crucial intangible.  Water for Elephants is the story of a man's youth, the experience he gains in a short period of time.  Essentially, it begins with him walking out on his final college exams and jumping a circus train almost accidentally.  This book is actually structured as a series of flashbacks, with the main character in roughly the present day, bracketing each chapter with comments about his current situation in a nursing home as contrast to his past adventures.  The main action takes place during the Great Depression, making for a fairly historical novel.Water for Elephants may feature a fairly original character with some serious common sense deficiencies, but Sara Gruen clearly did her research in terms of depictions of the period, inclusion of trade lingo, and depictions of animal behavior.  The adultery will probably keep it off high school reading lists, but I found it a pretty good window on what it depicted of the world outside of the circus.  This particular copy of the book also includes some commentary at the end regarding real circus history and anecdotes that were included in with the fiction.  Other than that, I know too little about life under the big top to comment on the depiction of events, other than to say that trains often did go slow enough to jump back then, even in the countryside, unlike now.I read this novel in less than a day, finding it to be a very compelling read, with a plot full of twists, even though the most climactic scene is also presented as the hook in the beginning preface chapter.

With no home to go to, he travels the rails until he hops onto a circus train.Camel Joe takes Jacob under his wing and ensures the young man gets a job. Jacob soon becomes the vet for the animals, but it's his interactions with August, Uncle Al, and Marlena that challenge his convictions. When Rose the elephant joins the circus, Jacob is put to the test. Will he follow his heart and stand up for his beliefs or walk away?Gruen's writing is easy to read. She's done her research and it shows. I especially liked how she used pictures to frame each chapter. The storyline is interesting. Jacob is coming-of-age and has to make decisions that aren't easy. The story alternates between old Jacob and young Jacob, and while not linear, Gruen pulls on the reader's heartstrings with the challenges old Jacob faces.  When a modern circus comes to the assisted living facility, old Jacob feels the tug of circus life, bringing the story full circle.For me, the best part was going on the emotional journey with the characters.

But I'm here to tell you that, in the case of Water for Elephants, it is definitely better late than never.Even in Depression-era America, Jacob Jankowski is doing pretty well for himself. He is a Cornell-trained veterinarian who only needs to sit for his final exams to make it official. He thinks he is in love but his lack of experience with the ladies means that he is more likely to be in lust than in love. For him, life is still pretty good.But things change sometimes when one least expects it, and for Jacob change comes in the form of a tragic traffic accident that claims the lives of both his parents. As bad as that is, it gets even worse when he learns that he has also been left destitute because his parents mortgaged everything to pay his Cornell tuition, and Jacob finds that he cannot sit still even long enough to finish his exams. Wanting to get away from it all, he hops the first freight train that comes along, avoids getting thrown back onto the tracks, and soon enough finds himself a member of Benzini Brothers traveling circus.Sara Gruen lets Jacob tell his own story by alternating the first person narrative of ninety-something-year-old Jacob, now living in a nursing home, with the voice of twenty-three-year-old Jacob as he experiences his summer with the Benzini Brothers. And what a story it is because the Benzini Brothers circus is not exactly The Ringling Brothers show and only circus owner, Uncle Al, tries to pretend that it is. Everything about the Benzini Brothers is second rate: the ragged animals in the zoo's menagerie are badly treated and lucky to eat once a day, the roustabouts and other workers are not paid consistently, the freaks are usually fakes or not all that freakish in the first place, and the girly show performer has been known to take paying customers after show hours.Jacob manages to catch on permanently with the show even with his incomplete veterinarian credentials and all goes relatively well until he falls in love with two ladies: Rosie, the elephant who joins the circus after he does, and Marlena, the beautiful young equestrian performer unfortunately married to the sadistic August, a man who beats both Marlena and Rosie.Gruen paints an unforgettable picture of life in a small-time Depression-era circus, an environment filled with filth, underfed animals and humans, cruelty, alcohol abuse, varying degrees of crime, lust, and callousness. Jacob, appalled at what he sees and what he learns about August, Marlena and Uncle Al, fights to maintain his sense of decency in a world he never knew existed, but his love for a married woman and his guilt at not doing more to defend Rosie from the beatings she suffers at the hands of August has him doubting himself.Surprisingly, as intriguing as the young Jacob's story is, the nursing home predicament that the older Jacob finds himself in is an equally touching one. The audio version of \"Water for Elephants\" (10 CDs and 11  hours long) is read by David LeDoux, as the young Jacob Jankowski and John Randolph Jones, who turns in an absolutely brilliant performance as Jacob, the old man. Frankly, both of the worlds created by Gruen are somewhat horrifying and both will linger in my memory for a long time.\"Water for Elephants\" is, however, a tiny bit blemished by its unlikely ending even though it is the kind of fairy tale ending that I personally would have wished for Mr. Jankowski. Some things, though, are just too good to be true - or to ring true in a novel even as good as this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Love Affair: Rosie, Marlena and Jacob", "unixReviewTime": 1229299200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2008"}

I am glad I did with this one because it had me asking the same questions The Hunger Games had me asking. (Maybe I'm destined to read books witht his theme until I figure out an answer or something like an answer from these texts.)The questions:  Why are people cruel? and Why do people put up with cruel people shaping their lives by maiming their lives?  In other words, why don't we naturally insist on freedom and peace?Water for Elephants author Sara Gruen has main character Jacob Jankowski, a Cornell-educated veterinarian who has not yet sat his exams because his parents died in a car crash shortly before he was scheduled to take them, working with a carnival during the Depression.  His cross-country train journey with the carnival takes him deep into the world of self-loathing, disappointment, betrayal, convenient friendship, and back-stabbing like there's no tomorrow.  At the center of that world is the woman named Marlena who becomes the love of his life and an elephant named Rosie who understands Polish. Both these ladies suffer beyond belief at the hands of August, Marlena's husband, the equestrian manager of the circus, and a paranoid schizophrenic whose physical and emotional abuse of anyone and everyone is terrifying.Only reluctantly did I put the book down whenever Rosie or Marlena became August's whipping posts. I wondered when Jacob would protect his women.  It wasn't enough he felt bad later for not standing up for Marlena or Rosie.  When would Jacob live up to his potential and do right?Which situation led me to wonder why some people are cruel and why so many others put up with them.  No answers yet. I'll keep reading.Gruen paints a world within a world when she draws the Depression-era carnival with her words. Its a tough place with a strict social order and very little hope for more or better. People are not diminished for holding onto what they have but for holding on at all costs. Time and time again, this novel shows that this kind of holding on is not worth it. Nevertheless, the hopelessness spawned by the Depression make moral compromises seem reasonable, logical.Water for Elephants is Jacob's memoir of his circus days. A nursing home inmate whose spirit refuses to be shackled to the home's waiting for death raison d'etre, he recounts his story 70 years or more after the fact, beginning with his nursing home experiences to a very sympathetic audience.

I too own horses, been around them and vets for nearly 5 decades. What little circus animal veterinary work Ms. Gruen describes in the book she probably got watching a cable TV station animal special.I also concur with the veterinarian reviewer on the slaughter of the horses. If a horse is forced to watch the other beside it die violently, most likely when it smells all that blood, you can bet the ranch it would break its' halter or rope and be nine miles gone.I also found it very distracting the numerous referrals to minute body languages while the characters talked. Also, even though the story started pretty promising, once Jacob got established as an employee in the circus, it bottomed out into nothing but petty bickerings and jealousies among all the circus employees. Yawn....It was fast reading, but I started hoping the thing would end soon. And, yeah, the animal stampede at the end I wasn't buying. I think Ms. Gruen could have just watched Nat.

The frustration with this battle between body and mind is poignantly revealed as we watch him testing the limits of his mobility and self-perseverance. Most of the time his `cantankerous' behavior is met with unsympathetic results.It's easy to understand how eating a steady diet of tediously bland and mushy foods when one has the teeth to chew on a cob of corn or a piece of meat could make one somewhat cranky!Had he been in his own home or cared for by relatives, the result probably would have been different....he'd have gotten a `real' dinner instead of visit by the Home's Psychiatrist with a diagnosis of geriatric depression followed by an unwanted dosing of Elavil.By alternating back in forth in time, I was able to be more empathetic with the 90 (or 93) year old Jacob. Seeing his youthful tragedies and how this angst over the sudden loss of his parents forces his life in a totally new and unexpected course is pivotal.He flees to survive.... and survive he does.... in a very gritty and cut-throat environment.There is no \"safety net\" under this circus act and it's every man for himself. Given the time (depression-era) and situation, the harshness of this existence becomes quite credible.I think that this tough past, in part, helps the reader to understand why he's not very comfortable being coddled and restricted within the sanitary and ordered life of the Nursing Facility.He is left unchallenged and bored without much support from his dutiful, albeit rather distant children and grandchildren.

Jacob Jankowski is now ninety three years old and in an \"assisted living\" facility, when the circus comes to town.  This brings back startling memories of his early life, when his world fell apart and he found himself on a circus train heading into his future.On the brink of passing his final exams for veterinary school, Jacob is informed that his parents have just died in an automobile accident.  Adding insult to injury, their house and practice were mortgaged to pay for his school and there's nothing left for Jacob.  He walks out of his final exam and keeps walking, until finding himself beside a railroad track.  Jumping the next train, he later realizes it's a circus train.  An old man named Camel helps him out, and gets him hired on with the show as the veterinarian.Jacob winds out bunking with a recalcitrant dwarf named Kinko and working for a man named August who's married to Marlena, a horse performer and a beautiful woman.  Marlena is off-limits, but Jacob can't help but admire her from afar.A twist of fate bring Rosie to the scene, an elephant abandoned by another defunct circus.  It seems Rosie is useless as a performer, and left under August's brutal treatments, until Jacob discovers that Rosie responds to the Polish language rather than English.  Once the language barrier is broken, Rosie becomes a star.  I could keep prattling on but I don't want to ruin the book.'Water For Elephants' is a beautifully written tale.  Switching back and forth between Jacob's current situation in his nursing home and his memories of the past, there's never a slow moment in Gruen's perfect prose.  The story is rich and well researched, the characters practically sparkle with life, and I could smell the animals and feel the train lurching beneath my feet.This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I suppose it helps that I love circus books and freak show books, but 'Water For Elephants' is more a book on humanity, and what sometimes lurks beneath the smiles and happy faces of troubled minds.  It's about greed and cliques, its about the depression era job desperation, its about abuse, and most of all its about the human heart.  Don't miss out on this 10 star tale.

The story revolves around Jacob, a Cornell trained veterinary student who drops out suddenly before his final exams after the loss of his parents and joins a circus traveling by train across the country. The story is split into two perspectives: the story of 90 something year Jacob, now suffering from dementia (and struggling with the loss of his dignity) in an assisted living facility, recounting his youth as the circus veterinarian in flashbacks. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It is obvious that Sara Gruen put a great deal of research into circus life, which I found fascinating. I had an extremely difficult time reading about the animal abuse, although perhaps this was necessary within the plot to enhance the reader's hatred for August and Uncle Al (as if the redlighting was not enough!).

I originally didn't know if I could get into a story about circus performers during the depression era, but Sara Gruen does an amazing job of bringing the train circus and the characters to life, so even if you don't wanna, you care!Jacob Jankowski is left to live out his years in a home, and like so many elderly today, is left thinking no one really cares and there's nothing really to get up for anymore.  People mistakenly think that just because you get older, you no longer need to \"live\" but you do, even at 90-something years old.  Getting off of that horse before it bucks, I loved Jacob.  He's fiesty and perpetually in a sarcastic, bad mood.  He made me laugh, cry and scream with frustration toward those who were making him feel like less than a human.

Rosie, the intelligent, beautiful elephant ... well,  you fall in love with her right along with Jacob. This was one of those occasions where you love the book so much as you're reading, that the closer you get to the conclusion, you get really scared that the author is going to drop the ball.

One is the present day, real-life existance of elderly residents in an assisted living facility. Their story is told through the eyes of a \"90-something\" year old man recuperating from a broken hip. At the same time, this character, Jacob we learn is his name, regales us with  life as a member of a circus from the past. Both stories are filled with such strong detail that we as the reader, are drawn back and forth from the past to the present in gentle surprise. We are introduced to the emotional roller-coaster details of a young man's life, many of which he is not a willing participant. However, we learn that he has a depth of character and courage that carries him through life's troubles when many of us today would want to give up. We find him using those same character traits to overcome some \"curve-ball throws\" that at \"93\", life is still pitching his way. Ms. Gruen has done a superb job of blending the past and present, and even gives us a hint of the future of this gallant man's life. Her book is so well researched that the reader might begin to feel it is a biography rather than fiction. This book will hold your interest throughout, especially the tales of the circus from a by-gone era and even the unfortunate activities of life in elder-care facilities that haunt us today.

{"reviewerID": "A3RFJ2Q2XFHDPY", "asin": "0002007770", "reviewerName": "Sheryl Sorrentino", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "I enjoyed this book, but did not find it to be the \"home run\" I expected or was led to believe it would be. The most moving, authentic passages were delivered by 93-year-old Jacob Jankowski. You just gotta love this elderly gent. The chapters in his voice gave me a new understanding of what it means to be old and alone; the fact that Gruen could craft such a believable male character, to my way of thinking anyhow, redeems many of this book's other flaws.I read numerous positive and negative reviews on amazon, and I agree with several other reviewers that Jacob can sometimes be a bit frustrating, in that he fails to take appropriate action when it seems most called for, and at other times gets all up-in-arms and confrontational over far lesser infractions. But to me, this makes him a human and believable character. Haven't we all \"lamed out\" when we should have taken action, or overreacted when we shouldn't have? What I hate even more is when a character is always ready, willing and able to jump through impossible hoops to save the day. If I only wanted that in my literary characters, I'd stick to James Bond novels. I do, however, agree with many other reviewers who pointed out that some dialogue is a bit too pat and unbelievable for both the era and the circumstances in which this story is supposed to have taken place.But what I simply do not get is why so many readers are up in arms about the so-called graphic sex scenes. They were neither numerous nor particularly offensive, but I guess sensibilities are wide-ranging where sex is concerned. I suppose the sideshow scene with Barbara and her magnificent boobs could be characterized as somewhat sexist, but so what? It was provocative and engaging. And while that scene and Jacob's \"initiation\" could be labeled both gratuitous and graphic,  I would argue that any graphic sex scene is gratuitous. Writers always have the option of \"panning to the flickering candle\" rather than telling us what the heck is happening. I give an author points for taking the risk of telling me. Besides which, I'd consider the absence of raunchy performances and sexual hanky-panky in a book about a traveling circus to be an inauthentic, gaping omission. So while I could have taken or left these two particular scenes, I believe they were well written and have their place in this story.All of that said, my biggest complaints about this book are Marlena's shallowness, and the mounting melodrama as the story nears its (preposterous) ending. Though Marlena is perhaps the second most important character in this novel, I found her to be vapid, insipid and uninspiring. I thought Rosemary (the assisted-living home nurse) was far more endearing and believable, for as minor a character as she was. True, the villains (Uncle Al, August) were likewise a bit \"canned,\" but I can forgive a lack of character development for certain secondary characters because, after all, an author has but so many pages in which to tell her story. But Marlena, as the circus's star performer and Jacob's love interest, should have been better developed.  And I suppose I simply must accept the ending for what it is--something of an outrageous letdown.Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed Water for Elephants. It drew me in enough to hold my interest, and it certainly has its strong points. For example, I thought the author did a fabulous job bringing the animal characters to life as sentient, unique beings. I loved the aged Jacob, and liked his young counterpart only slightly less. I will admit, I expect more from (and am therefore harder on) traditionally-published books than self-published ones so I gave Water for Elephants three stars rather than four. If a writer is lucky enough to get published, then I hold him or her to a higher standard than schlubs like myself who try to put a good, thought-provoking product before the public without the benefit of editors, professional cover designers or national distribution networks.

It captures a time and environment that stirs the curiosity of young and old.  Who wouldn't be interested in exploring the dysfunctional dynamics of the circus family, during the perilous era of the early 30's. It allows you to finally be able to, run away to the circus, in the comfort and safety of your easy chair.  And, as intriguing as some scenes might be, it makes you just as glad you never did.While written simplistically, the messages run deep.  The cruelty that existed during those hard times and the effect on man and beast, were heartbreaking.  It was particularly difficult to envision the animal abuse and neglect, but it was so integral to the story that you had no choice.  It was a reminder, that left unchecked and unsupervised, that the weakest amongst us will frequently be delegated the scapegoats.  It was also a reminder of the evil that can be unleashed by man when faced with desperate times.Visiting the Senior Jankowski was particularly delightful.  A mere \"90, or maybe 93,\" as he frequently chimed, his struggle to retain dignity and independence was inspirational and beautifully drawn out.  Gruen also did a great job moving seamlessly between the Senior Jankowski and his youthful, 23 year old counterpart. Sometimes I wouldn't even notice, even though decades separated the characters, when we'd moved from one to the other, which is not easily accomplished.  They were both struggling with the angst of the past, the ugliness of the moment and the uncertainty of moving forward.I've read reviews where some took exception to using Schizophrenia as an excuse for one of the characters cruelty and explosive episodes, as his behaviors were not typical for Schizophrenia.  And, they definitely weren't!  However, in the 30's Schizophrenia was not well understood and likely frequently misdiagnosed, becoming a catch-all for describing many signs of mental illness. I don't believe this should detract from the story.My grievances are few, but I did have some issues with the ending, which I found unrealistic, although I'm not sure we were intended to interpret the ending so concretely.  If you take it beyond face value, the ending can have some very deep meaning.

That is, to get so involved in the storyline, I forget about my immediate environment.  Authors can achieve this goal by producing actions that borderlines the plausible.

When the actions totally lack plausibility the reader becomes aware of one's immediate environment.  Within this scenario, the author forces the reader to assess the logic of the actions and the flow of the storyline is disrupted.  Somewhere between plausible and implausible is best for a storyline.Although Gruen is a talented writer with a rare command of the written word, her description of flunking out of Veterinarian school was too implausible.  EVEN Cornell professors would give a second chance if a student's parents died prior to comprehensive exams!  The implausible wrinkle forced me into reality throughout my reading experience.  It wasn't until the chapter 23 (page 314) when I realized that Gruen skillfully left out some critical information.  Thus, what seemed too implausible at the beginning became reasonable at the end.  We reach borderline plausibility.Yet, the novel doesn't end there.  A second storyline that Gruen skillfully weaves throughout the novel emerges into a second borderline plausible event.

Schell", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "In a long list of critical praise on the first four pages of the paperback edition for Water For Elephants, The Chicago Tribune is quoted as saying the novel is \"so compelling, so detailed and vivid, that I couldn't bear to be torn away from it for a single minute\".My sentiments exactly.Water For Elephants is one of the most engrossing novels I've read so far this year (another is Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns) and now that I have finished it in what seemed a whirlwind of time (I stay at home with two small children and I still read it in three days!), Sara Gruen is among my list of favorite authors.  I look forward to the debut of her fourth novel Ape House scheduled to be released in October of this year.The Canadian-American author doesn't waste any time putting the reader in suspense.  The novel starts off smack dab in the midst of a cacophonous stampede of circus animals (lions and tigers and bears, oh my!) and someone's impending doom.  Want to find out what happened?  Read the book and I'll guarantee you won't stop `til you reach the end.  The engrossing tale is told in flashbacks from the mind of Jacob Jankowski, a man who is encroaching the end of his life at an impressive ninety years of age (\"...or ninety-three.  One or the other.\").  Jacob resides at an assisted living facility and is the consummate old fart, crotchety and bitter about the black void of his current living.  It isn't until word that the circus is coming to town that something inside of him stirs and memories of his youth from the furthest recesses of his mind float to the murky surface.We are suddenly thrust into the past at the inception of the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three and a student in his final year at Cornell University working towards a degree in veterinary sciences when he is pulled out of class one day in 1931 to earth-shattering news - his parents are dead after a sudden and fatal car accident.  Left with little to fall back on, Jacob takes a short leave and returns to school to finish out the year but his grief over the loss of his mother and father shadows his professional goals and he walks out in the middle of his final test, the integral exam that will earn him his degree.  Having committed career suicide, Jacob goes walking aimlessly for an entire afternoon and inexplicably jumps a passing train in the night.  Little does he know that this one small act has just changed his entire future.After being roughed up by a car full of \"working men\", Jacob learns that he has just boarded the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (\"You done landed yer ass on a circus, boy\"), a big top rivaling the Ringling Brothers and headed by tyrannical ringmaster Alan Bunkel, dubbed \"Uncle Al\".  It isn't until he lets loose that he's a Cornell-educated vet that he gets placed in the menagerie working with all the animals, in particular a bull elephant named Rosie.  Jacob grows fond of Rosie as well as the other animals but his heart really belongs to a woman named Marlena, a resplendent young performer who is inconveniently married to an emotionally unstable man named August, the equestrian director and superintendent of animals.  As Jacob's love for Marlena grows, so does his hatred of August as he watches him grow ever more suspicious and ever more brutal.  His violent streak spills over onto Rosie, who is rumored to be \"dumb as rocks\" and disobedient ever since she was acquired and August makes her pay for her insubordination with recurrent vicious floggings.To make matters worse, Uncle Al constantly shafts his workers and performers by docking and/or refraining to pay them for their work and when someone's authority is unduly challenged, people mysteriously disappear in the dead of night.  Jacob's unwavering morals suddenly pit him in a dangerous situation and with a love triangle rapidly brewing and a wild animal reaching its breaking point, the thunder will crack loud and hard before the storm.The book flits back and forth between the past and present and the transition is fluid - there is no confusion between the youthful Jacob and his ninety-year old self.  The descriptions of the circus are vivid, particularly the behavior of the animals within the menagerie.  Being an avid supporter of numerous animal and wildlife charities, this isn't a surprise coming from Gruen and it's some very interesting character development indeed.Her human counterparts in the story don't suffer from this, thankfully.  Jacob is a well-written character, the youthful version brimming with naivete and conviction and the older of course wiser but still resolute as ever.  Gruen shows with Jacob that even after the utmost disastrous of events that time can reign down upon a life, some things about our character ultimately never change.  The unpredictability of August is also queerly fascinating - with expertly written passages of steely smiles, cold gazes and passive-aggressive undertones, the reader will feel just as perplexed and wary of him as Jacob does.Along with extensive research on the subject of circuses during the Depression, Gruen included 17 black-and-white archival photos of circuses throughout the 1930's; the photos are prominently featured at the beginning of about every other chapter and lend the story some great visuals to feed upon.Bottom Line: A superb novel, well worth the time and money to read.  With a movie deal in the works, pick it up now before the film adaptation spoils it in either the best or worst way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gruen Is Greatness", "unixReviewTime": 1212105600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2008"}

This book is so wonderful, and so very different from anything that I've read, that I still can't believe it.  Sara Gruen has written a book that is so carefully researched and so well-written that it puts the reader right into the story which is Depression-time circus life.  Jacob is a character that is so real, both as he's portrayed at a young age, and as he is portrayed as a 93 year old living with his memories in an old aged home.  The story is poignant and also sad.  It is quite heartbreaking to think of the way the animals lived that travelled with train circuses during this time.  And they had all manner of animals, from elephants to apes to zebras to horses to the big cats like lions and tigers.  They even had polar bears if you can imagine!  This book is dark in its portrayal of circus life circa 1920, but it's also heartwarming in Ms. Gruen's portayal of the many kinds of people that also travelled with these circuses.  These train circuses were an entire community and everyone in them was part of the family, including the animals.  The story is also a love-story that is so beautifully depicted amongst this varied kaleidoscope of characters and the wonderful animals.  And what about amazing Rosie?  She is an elephant that I will never forget!

Silverman \"ReaderGeode\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Change after a life disaster drives this wonderful tale of Jacob and his life for several months thereafter.  Jacob tells the tale himself as a nonagenarian some seven decades after the fact.  His final exams to end his veterinary medicine degree, and his anticipated life following graduation, come to a crashing halt, and leave him wandering aimlessly.  Without considering its consequences, and noticing no details of the train, he stows away on a passing one.  Having hopped a circus train, Jacob initially faces some ugly hardships before his training leads him to his responsibility in the show.  Along the way, Jacob encounters challenges and loyalties, well-meaning others and some with decidedly despicable intentions and/or means.  The characters, the lovely and good-hearted Marlena, who is the star of the show, and her husband August, who is volatile in many unappealing ways, as well as Kinko/Walter, Jacob's initially disgruntled roommate, are reasonably strong secondary characters,  This reader wishes that Marlena had been fleshed out better, but that's a minor complaint.  Jacob is terrific, flawed as Gruen says she wishes of her characters, and a good man placed in difficult circumstances, a circus where the rules don't make much sense, particularly if one holds egalitarian views of one's co-workers.  This reader found the practice of redlighting to be totally repugnant, and frankly a bit upsetting.  Jacob's interaction with the members of the Menagerie, the animals, repeatedly shows his appropriateness for his career.  Several of the animals' personalities stand out.  Jacob in his youth adapts sometimes well and sometimes badly.  Gruen handles Jacob as an old man nicely, making him whole and believable with the challenges of his age, but still generally holding onto his faculties and sense of independence.  Rosemary, one of his nurses, is a lovingly and warmly portrayed woman.  Without spoilers, the ending is terrific, too.  The pacing and flow of the writing help move this gracefully.

I would have liked to have seen a little more depth form the main characters. And there were a few unbelievable aspects - leaving an Ivy League education in the final hours, knowing what their family sacrificed to provide it,  just to try and forget their grief?  It would have been very disrespectful and irresponsible to do so.  But, without this selfish act the story would not have moved forward... My favorite aspect was the animals.

What sets Water for Elephants apart is not only the incredible quantity and quality of research that went into it, but the way Gruen employs her pool of researched knowledge to craft her plot, characters and milieu.In lesser hands, a story or book that relies on heavy research can hit the reader over the head with it, to the detriment of concentration and enjoyment. Long explanatory paragraphs; tedious but unnecessary details; the sacrificing of the Big Picture to sideshows--these are sins that are distressingly common in historical novels. It's like the author has taken all this trouble; you've got to see what he dug up, like it or not.In Gruen's case, not one detail is out of place. Not one fact is gratuitous. Everything fits; everything moves the plot along or enhances the characters. The picture develops fully, in living color, without clutter; the settings are so true, you can smell the young hobos and their fire and touch the sweat on the horses. The most unbelievable bit is believable, because you trust Gruen as a storyteller. She is that good a writer.I hate to review a book when so many have, and god knows my opinion won't make a whit's difference in the sales of this book or its success.

I download \"samples\" of all kinds of books.  If I can get hooked in the first few chapters, well clearly the author deserves the book sale.That is exactly what happened with Water for Elephants.  Almost immediately I was completely drawn into the story.  Ms. Gruen uses an effective framing device for her tale.  Nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski is telling his story in flashbacks from his present in a nursing home.  And it is the story of his first job out of veterinary school.  The year is 1931 and the country is embroiled in the Depression.  Tragedy sends Jacob fleeing his orderly life.  Without trying to, the young man winds up running away to the circus.Water for Elephants is a coming of age novel, a buddy tale, a period drama, and a love story.  It's one of those rare novels that seems to captivate almost all readers.  I came late to it, but I was as entranced as all those who have raved before me.  Gruen's prose is strong, but it's her characters and setting that capture the imagination.  I haven't been to a circus in decades, and have no particular interest in that life.  But Sara Gruen is a fantastically gifted storyteller, in the most elemental sense of the word.  I will be grabbing future novels upon publication.

It turns out to be a circus train.  The story alternates between the few months Jacob spends with the Benzini Bros. circus during the Depression and the current day, in which Jacob is 90+ years old and an unhappy resident of a nursing home.  Although most of the story centers on the circus years, the author does an excellent job of showing the loss of companionship, the loss of independence, and the loss of dignity that accompany old age.  It's these passages that ultimately make this a sad book for me.  No matter how the circus portion of the story turns out, we know how unhappy Jacob is at the tail end of his life.Although Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the unhappily married star of the equestrian act, the love story wasn't the main focus of the story for me.  In fact, that aspect of the story didn't pick up steam until fairly late in the book.  It was more of a coming of age/adventure story.  The author did a wonderful job of researching Depression-era circus life and making the reader a part of it. And what a brutal life it was:  the horrors of poisonous bootleg liquor, prostitution, terrible treatment of both animals and staff members, lack of pay, and &#34;red lighting&#34; - throwing people off the moving train who had fallen out of favor or were simply no longer worth the expense.  If they were lucky, they were thrown off near a town.  If they were unlucky, they were thrown off a trestle.  But it's also a story of survival and caring among both the animals and the people.

Jacob Jankowski begins the story of his life when he is a very old man living in a nursing home where he is less than happy.  The story goes back to his young life when he is a veterinary student and suddenly loses his parents in an auto crash.  After the funeral, Jacob plans on going back to school and returns, only to be unable to take his exams, writing nothing and walking away from his years of education to join the Benzini Brothers circus. Because of his veterinary knowledge, Jacob is assigned the care of the animals and their problems.August, the animal trainer, is married to Marlena the elephant-rider and beautiful star of the circus.  Jacob's mistake is falling in love with her, because August is a brutal man, both with his animals and with people.  Often an elephant named Rosie gets the brunt of his anger, and so does Marlena, and eventually Jacob.  The rubes suffer under just about everyone in this circus, which has a long way to go to even give Ringling Brothers a thought about it.What I enjoyed most about this book is the very colorful and accurate information that Gruen researched well and delivers about the circus.  The acts in the ring, the different people who make up the circus and the pecking order among them makes for an excellent story.  I found the ending fairly predictable, but I was glad I was right.

You're going to want to gulp it all down quickly but be advised that you will not have time to savor the rich writing and brilliant characterizations unless you slow down and absorb the tale.Water for Elephants is set in a traveling circus in the early 1930s.  The narrator, Jacob, is set to finish veterinary school and join his father's practice when tragedy strikes, leaving him an orphan and penniless.  Unable to cope with his change in fortune, he wanders off aimlessly and finds himself somehow attached to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, tending to the animals and developing relationships with performers and regular workers alike.  Gruen gives us some of the best characters in this novel:  Marlena, the beautiful horsewoman trapped in a marriage she no longer wants; Walter the dwarf who is forced to share a sleeping berth with Jacob; Camel, the old drunk who meets with an unfortunate turn of events; and Uncle Al, the devious, sinister mastermind behind the circus's success.  As brilliant as these people are, it is also the animals who must be lauded:  Bobo the chimp, Silver Star the dying horse, Rex the lion who is afraid to leave his cage, and Rosie the elephant, who shows more intelligence than many a human could hope to possess.Told in chapters that alternate between the circus life and Jacob's current existence in a nursing home, this story is marvelous.

Throughout the course of the  book you see Jake in the nursing home and Jake in the past.  Jake in the nursing home is looking forward to seeing the circus which has come to town.  But first he has to deal with a couple more days until that time comes and you learn a little bit of what his like is like in the nursing home.  He's not too happy and he every once in awhile starts to reminisce what it was like when he was much younger and he became part of a circus.  Since he had been in veterinary school before stowing away on the circus train he ends up being put in charge of the animals.  One of which is an elephant.  The elephant is not treated well at all and Jake even becomes frustrated with it until the day he realizes that the elephant doesn't understand commands because he learned them in another language.  Once that barrier is broken he and the elephant end up developing a close relationship as he's about the only one who actually treats the animals with any compassion and care.  He also falls in love with Marlena who is married to the very temperamental ring master.  Considering the time period of the book, it's quite possible that her husband suffered from manic depression as the man's mood swings go from very happy to incredibly abusive and destructive.  Over the course of the book we find out more of what happened between Jake and his elephant and also what happened with him and Marlena.Throughout the course of the book you learn a lot about what circuses were like back in the thirties.  Sometimes a bigger circus would acquire a smaller circus and combine the two.  A lot of times the workers went a long ways toward being paid.  And sometimes the owners of the circus would scramble from opportunity to opportunity in order to have enough money to keep the circus running.  And the performers traveled from city to city by train, which would have not only been hard on them but as the animals as well.  If you like animals this can be a difficult book to read from time to time, but it's a fascinating look at circuses that I enjoyed the book very much anyway.  Someday I may get the sequel to find out more of what happened to Jake both past and present.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Don't know about the movie, but it was a good book.", "unixReviewTime": 1347148800, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2012"}

Once I started seeing trailers for the movie adaptation of the novel with Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson, I finally extracted the book from its place in the bookshelf and read it.

The author clearly depicts what circus life was like in the 1930s and builds larger than life circus folk whose personalities bounce off of the novel's pages.

How Rosie died? Did she love the Jankowski children? Did she live at the Chicago zoo? Who was with her when she died?Great story. Well told. Brutal in some parts. Bleak, too. But that was life in the Great Depression.*********************************************************************************It's 1931. Jacob Jankowski, 23, has the world by the tail. He's ten days away from final exams at Cornell University's School of Veterinarian Medicine. After graduation, Jacob plans to join his father's practice back home in Norwich. His life is neat and tidy, with only blue skies on his horizons.Jacob's carefully plotted-out life begins to unravel when his parents are killed in a car accident and he finds out his father had lost all his savings in the bank failures of 1929. Not only is the money gone, Jacob discovers his father has left huge loans he cannot possibly repay. Jacob can't eat. He can't sleep. And, because his parents mortgaged everything to send him to college, he can't even keep the family home.After the funerals, Jacob returns to school \"because no other options occur to me\". Forty minutes into his final tests, he suddenly stands up, walks out of the room, off of the campus, and out of the town of Ithaca, New York.\"I walk until my legs hurt and my feet blister. And then I stop because I am tired and hungry and have no idea where I am. It's as though I've been sleepwalking and suddenly woken to find myself here.\"Jacob hops the first train that passes by and soon discovers he's landed right in the middle of the Benzini Brothers circus, a second-rate traveling show that crisscrosses the country, usually just one step ahead of local law enforcement.Jacob gets hired on as the circus vet and spends a long hot summer tending to the circus' animals and learning about the underbelly of life.Gruen, the author of \"Riding Lessons\" and \"Flying Changes,\" tells Jacob's story in the first person, using a series of flashbacks to move from the 30s to the present.Jacob is now \". . . ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.\" He's staying in a nursing home, recuperating from a broken hip. He's not at all happy about his circumstances, but he's enough of a realist to know he can no longer alone.A circus is setting up near Jacob's nursing home, creating quite a stir among the residents and agitating Jacob's long-hidden memories.\"I don't talk much about those days. Never did. I don't know why - I worked on circuses for nearly seven years, and if that isn't fodder for conversation, I don't know what is.Actually, I do know why: I never trusted myself. I was afraid I'd let it slip. I knew how important it was to keep her secret, and keep it I did - for the rest of her life, and then beyond.In seventy years, I've never told a blessed soul.\"In the Author's Note, Gruen said she spent \"four and a half months acquiring the knowledge necessary to do just to this subject. . .\"Gruen uses her impressive storytelling skills to give her readers an unblinking into the rich and sometimes brutal history of the American circus, freak show and all.Long after the last page is turned, Jacob's story lingers.

The novel's language flows beautifully from start to finish, making it an easy vacation read. Circus industry vernacular sets the story persuasively, though other reviewers have noted implausibilities. Determined fault finders could ponder why the author downplays the relationships of circuses with the locals, railroading lore, and depression era culture. But at some point these details would get in the way of telling a good story.While the ending is touching, the climax proceeds from one wrong note to another. The protagonist woos a married woman, uses her husband's outrage for justification, and undertakes an attack too far out of character. Most of the protagonist's friends are conveniently written off as the author describes 'redlighting' (health care we can all afford without the dad-burn gummint) where sick people and their friends are thrown under the train in the dark. The antagonists are killed off the next day, in even more unlikely \"Acts of God\" executed and covered up by various animals. The speed at which the plot moves here may carry a movie viewer, but I found myself thinking \"I can't put this down right now, not because it's great, but because there won't be a plausible place for me to pick it up again.\"Memories are notoriously convenient, self serving, or over dramatizing. So others might give this book more stars for its portrayal of the geriatric mind. Killing off most of the actors resolves the plot within the time constraints of TV or movies, at the cost of satisfying character development. Those who write from outlines will feel cheated that the author didn't plan ahead.Injustice distresses casual readers. Extreme events in near-immediate retribution for evil motives will jar readers who seek plausibility. Unpunished sins of the protagonist claw at the human desire for balance. But the fast transition back to faded memories of the next few years does imitate an older person's memories. So when the book reaches its touchingly implausible conclusion, lots of readers may finish feeling satisfied.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Fast moving but not inspirational", "unixReviewTime": 1316390400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2011"}

I have no idea what they look like in the actual book, but it would've been nice (for the Kindle version, at least) to dedicate one full page, or half a page to the circus pictures.

For me, this is the case for WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. THE NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list summarizes the book by saying \"A young man and en elephant save a Depression era circus.\" It made me want to purchase the book just to see how it happens. One could argue as to whether the one sentence summary is an apt description of the book, but whether a reader agrees with the summary or not, most will agree that WATER FOR ELEPHANTS turns out to be a novel well worth exploring.The book tells the story of Jacob Janowski, a young man with a promising career ahead of his as a partner in his father's veterinary practice. Jacob looses everything upon the accidental and sudden death of his parents. Not sure of how to proceed, Jacob decides not to take his veterinary exams and wanders. He finds himself on a train and before he knows it he's put to work. He soon discovers he's now a member of the crew with the Benzini Brothers' Circus, a rag tag outfit that claims to be \"The Most Spectacular Show on Earth\" and has a true hatred for the far superior \"Greatest Show on Earth Ringling Brothers. His credentials are soon discovered and the circus owner sees that his medical skills are put to good use. As he travels from town to town he gets involved in the inner workings of the circus, falls in love and develops a number of friendships both with circus members and the animals, most notably \"Camel,\" a man severe alcoholic, Walter/Kinko, a performer, the lovely Marlena and her husband August, as well as a chimp named Bobo and an elephant named Rosie.The book is more than a story about a young man who runs away with the circus. When we meet Jacob, he's not a young man.  He's in his nineties and living in a nursing home. His body is failing but his mind is sharp, but few people notice because it's assumed by many of the staff of the nursing home he's like the other patients, most of whom have Alzheimer's or some form of dementia. He's lonely and knows that no one would understand or believe his story.Juxtaposing the older Jacob with the story itself is where we see author Sara Gruen's gifts as a writer. Her telling of the young Jacob's adventures is storytelling at its best. We feel as if we're traveling with the Benzini Brothers' circus and the situations that occur and the people who populate the story are real. Yet we also feel for the older Jacob, a man who is truly trapped, perhaps with the best of intentions by who love him, but none the less trapped. Readers do become emotionally involved in so many sections of the book.  You almost want to find out where this nursing home is, go and visit Jacob, take him out for dinner and drinks and make him tell the story. He's that memorable a character.The hardcover version of this book did well, and the paperback version seems to be following suit. No doubt it will be a favorite for book clubs across the country, and no doubt it will move readers for years to come. While it may be clich&eacute; to say so, this is a book that will not easily be forgotten.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Be Warned: This Book Will Move You!", "unixReviewTime": 1187913600, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2007"}

Plunkett", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Water for ElephantsBy Sara GruenIn the experience of this reviewer romantic books of any kind are generally written for those with a sentimental heart, and a genre that I try to avoid. Who doesn't like a good love story now and again, but the modern romantic drama or comedy seems to be written for a specific audience. Without trying to be presumptuous or overly sexist modern romances are a genre mainly written by women for women. So when Water for Elephants was suggested and then selected to be read by the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club I assumed it was a book that was written for the opposite sex and one I would find hard to enjoy. But as it is warned so often not to make assumptions and hardly ever heeded, I found that my assumptions about Water for Elephants were incorrect. Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, a bestselling author and book is a romantic drama that can be enjoyed by all readers.Water for Elephants is a story about an aged man, Jacob Jankowski who we discover in a nursing home and through his memories we are taken on a dark and romantic journey to his youth as a veterinarian in a traveling circus. Jacobs past comes rushing to the front of his mind when a circus arrives and sets up next to the nursing home he resides in. In Water for Elephants the reader gets to experience a forbidden love between Jacob and one of the star performers of the Benzini Brothers circus, Marlena. The whirl wind romance between Jacob and Marlena is both suicidal and heart melting. The reader also gets a good dose of violence and sexual content as the traveling circus life during the depression era of the 1930's is unfolded for us in dramatic fashion by Sara Gruen in Water for Elephants. Add in an elephant who understands only the Polish language, a masturbating midget and his dog Queenie and an untold number of corrupt acts and you will discover why Water for Elephants is a romantic story that can be enjoyed by just about any one.Although the idea of a nursing home has been used by other authors as the stage for telling a tale about ones past it does not hinder the story. Sara's creative writing abilities and her knowledge about all things circus keep the nursing home in the background of the readers mind until the very end. And if there is anything that could be considered a hindrance to the book it might be the end itself. The end of the story, where  Jacob, 90 years young rides off into the sunset with the traveling circus that was set up next to his nursing home, creates more questions than can be answered by the novel.All things considered Water for Elephants is a well written novel by Sara Gruen. The work of literature has the ability to capture the attention of both men and women. Water for Elephants is a unique romantic drama that will capture your attention with heart melting romance, intense episodes of violence, graphically detailed sexual acts and a traveling circus. Water for Elephants is an unforgettable and exciting novel that will have you talking about it long after you have read it.(written on 7/10/2011 by the administrator of the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club, based loosely on the  discussions held by the club about the novel Water for Elephants.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club Review", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2011"}

Gruen's unapologetic descriptions of circus life for all involved, the workers, the performers, and the animals strips away the romanticized idea that running away with the circus could ever be the answers to one's troubles in life.

He was about to graduate from Cornell with his degree in veterinary medicine when he gets word that both of his parents have died.  Not only that, but he finds out that because of the economy (during the great depression) his father's veterinary business was so far under that their house is taken and the business is gone.  He has nothing left but to take his final exam and somehow start a new life completely on his own.  In the middle of his exam he breaks down, runs away and hops a train out of town...  but it's not just any train, it ends up being a circus train for the Benzini Bros circus and they don't like stowaways.  This begins a roller coaster ride that will last 3 1/2 months with a crash course in taking care of large animals, understanding business, befriending a grouchy midget and learning what love truly is.Passion, hatred, murder and even a wild animal stampede add to the delight I found in this book.

There is no romantic vision here: conditions for workers and animals alike were harsh and even brutal.  Workers and stage performers were at the mercies of greedy owners and managers whose only concern was profit.  If workers weren't needed, they might even be tossed off the circus train at night.  And the animals were treated even worse.  Jacob, the main character, finds he can't finish veterinary school due to certain tragic events, and takes a job in a travelling circus, where he's treated somewhat better than the average worker because of his healing skills.  But he falls in love with the wrong woman, and begins to fear for his own life.  Fortunately for him, there are co-workers who though mistreated, still have that spark of humanitarianism remaining.\"Water for Elephants\" is a riveting story that does not shy away from acts of brutality.  However, I did have two quibbles with the book.  First, the realization that the elephant, who quickly becomes the star of the circus, possesses a rather extraordinary knowledge of a foreign language (as opposed to English) seemed a bit hackneyed to me.  Second, there was too much of a disconnect between the easy-going humane young Jacob, and the old bitter nursing home resident that he became.  Even though Jacob experienced the horrors described so vividly in the book, obviously the circus got into his blood, and he seemed to have led a relatively happy and comfortable life afterwards.  Why then did he become so bitter and unhappy?  It was as if the author forgot to write a bridge between young and old Jacob.  Even so, Gruen has written a remarkable book that will be on many \"must read\" lists for years to come.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "(four and half stars)  A travelling circus during the depression", "unixReviewTime": 1224460800, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2008"}

The sight launches him into a reverie of his post-college days as a veterinarian in a depression-era circus.

I braced myself for anxiety but that was unnecessary. What I was introduced to was a feisty gentleman telling his story about a journey of a fascinating period in a young man's life.

It covers his duties of caring for the animals, his friendships and his untouchable heart throb. Jacob may not be the most controversial character you will ever read about and does lack some spunk and fortitude, but he's a good guy in the story and you'll be rooting for him from start to end.Some of the animal situations are disturbing but realize it was reality of the time. I am thankful there has been a good deal of enlightenment since then. The animals, incidentally are a huge part of the story and I found them every bit as interesting, if not more so, than the human characters.This was a well researched, well written look at a bizarre lifestyle. My biggest complaint is I kept wishing there was some type of lexicon or glossary because I did not have a good understanding of some the jargon, and the terms weren't described well enough.

For some reason we are drawn to the enchantment of the circus, so the setting was interesting enough to keep our attention.  We thought the novel captured the spirit of the traveling circus and pulled the curtain on some of the more sleazy aspects of the business.  The treatment of the animals was at times appalling as was the practice of chucking circus workers from moving trains.In many ways, the characters were almost as entertaining as the circus.  Jacob was complex and real.  The lovely Marlena was just as intriguing and provocative in real life as she was in her animal act.  The head animal trainer was pretty much a complete jerk-bag throughout.  Rosie the Elephant was incredibly enduring and a formidable animal character.  And the bearded lady... yeesh.So why didn't we love this book? We're not sure.  It just felt like something was missing.

The pictures painted by words are so vivid that I felt like I was watching the action on screen.The story is set in the 1930s and follows Jacob Jankowski, a vetrinary school dropout, and the few months he spends working for a circus (Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth). Jacob is exposed to the harsh lifestyle of a travelling circus. He meets Marlena, who is a performer, and falls in love. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the equestrian director (who hired Jacob in the first place).The central element of the book however, is the circus itself. The reader gets a look into the inner workings of show, the characters that work for it and this is done in a very dextrous way. Gruen makes the reader understand the technicalities of circus terminology and life without spelling out definitions. Her insight into the characters (with a few exceptions) is also very interesting. I found the beginning part of the book fascinating as the 90 or 93 year old Jankowski reflects on how things change with age.The criticism I have is that certain charcters are somewhat faceless. I found this to be true of Marlena. This makes her relationship with Jacob seem contrived and their interactions cliched. The dialogue between them towards the end is predictable.

I didn't know what to expect since I hadn't read any reviews about it, so I picked it up, and was not disappointed. I hate looking at other people's reviews before I read a book since they all give away so much of the plot and that irritates me. I like to discover what's going to happen on my own and I detest spoilers. In the end, I'm glad I took Amazon's advice because what I ended up with was a very accessible and entertaining story.I'm not saying this book is perfect by any means. I actually debated over whether to give it 4 or 5 stars, and I ended up going with 5 based almost exclusively on the fact that it was just such a unique and entertaining story. The author, Sara Gruen, colorfully illustrates the world of Depression Era circus life, while weaving in a distinctive coming of age type story, even if it's a little late in life for the main character, Jacob. Coming of age doesn't always have to mean \"teenage years\" and in fact can be about any time in a person's life where their life path drastically changes direction. This is absolutely the case for Jacob as he endures a huge devastating crisis that leads him to essentially run away with the circus in his early twenties...something kids across the country and all through the years have dreamed about on particularly hard days when things were just not going quite right for them. However, this particular circus in those particular times did not exactly embody the romantic idea of escaping the harsh reality of the real world, and in fact the result of Jacob's decision landed him in more trouble and heartache than he probably ever thought he'd encounter in his life.I think what I enjoyed most about this particular novel is that I actually learned a lot from it as well as was entertained by it. I don't know about you, but I didn't know too much about circus life in early 1900's America and I always find facts about the Depression and Prohibition life really interesting. Gruen incorporates a lot of circus and era terminology into the prose and even weaves a few true stories into the plot. Most interestingly, she includes amazing real photos of circus life at the beginning of most of the chapters. Between those visual aids and all the beautiful details in the writing, I could really picture everything from the sequined costumes the performers wore to the strangest freaks in the side show attraction to the inhumane treatment the roustabouts and animals had to endure to make the whole thing work. How ironic that they all had to suffer through such a harsh and unforgiving life to bring such a glitzy, fun and care-free show to a different town nearly every night during a horrible time in America's history where people desperately needed that kind of distraction in their harsh and unforgiving lives.I saw on one of the discussion forums about this novel that it has been optioned for a feature film and I am very excited to hear it. I read a lot of books, and I love it when I'm getting into one and I can just start to SEE it in my mind. I start casting it and think about which director would bring the best vision of it to the screen. I really hope that whoever ends up making it does it justice. There's so much potential to bring this to life using an exquisite color and texture palette, and I also hope that the studio doesn't compromise the author's vision of this world by watering it down do appeal to a broader audience. I can just see some ridiculous exec somewhere taking out characters and situations that aren't P.C. so as not to offend Middle America in order to raise ticket sales. That kind of censorship makes me sick and is exactly why so many good novels are turned into crappy movies nowadays.Without giving too much away, I'd just have to recommend this novel to anyone who's looking for an easy \"historical fiction\" read with a good, gripping story. There are times when you'll laugh, times when you'll feel uneasy, times you'll be sad and times when you'll be outraged. If you have serious problems with violence against humans and especially animals, you might want to think twice about reading this. Gruen states in the back of the book that she did extensive research to include many accurate portrayals of Depression Era circus life, and that means that often times things weren't pretty behind the scenes. There is also a fair amount of crude language and a few depictions of graphic sexual situations. If this were a film, it would most likely have an R rating for language, sexual situations, alcohol abuse and most especially violence. However, I like my stuff gritty and realistic, so it worked for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Greatest Show on Earth", "unixReviewTime": 1193702400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2007"}

I loved how the story was told in flashbacks and dream-sequences. Jacob Jankowski is a nintey-something year old man who has been abandoned by his family in a retirement home. One day Jacob sees a circus come to town through the windows in his retirement home. This circus coming to town forces his aging and forgetting mind to remember a time in his life when he had lost everything and ran away to escape it. He ends up jumping onto a circus train and joining the Benzini Brothers as the circus doctor. On his journey he meets many friends and enemies. The story then alternately goes from present day to depression-era 1930s. While he is working for the circus, the ringleader Uncle Al picks up an elephant from another circus who has just gone broke. I absolutely adore the relationship that forms between Jacob and Rosie (the elephant). Anyone who knows me knows how deeply I care about animals. To see this character stand up and take such responsibility for an elephant in the 1930s was nothing short of heartwarming. This is a book that I recommend. This is a book that I was able to breeze through and I was so sad when I turned to the last page. Speaking of the last page, I adored the ending of this book. It was uplifting and it told me that no matter how old you are, you still have room and time to continue chasing your dreams.Something that I noticed at one point in the book was how parallel Jacob's geriatric life was to Rosie's circus life. There was one quote in particular that I wanted to recall, but it was a library book so I didn't dare mark in it and I returned it prior to writing this. It had something to do with Jacob being friendless, in his nursing-home cage, being poked and prodded. The quote that I selected to open the post with also shows that relationship. This was said to Jacob by Rosemary the nurse. However, this could be also said to the awful August who continually expects Rosie to do the tricks that he wants without giving her any indication whatsoever what those tricks are. I'm sure that with a second reading I could pick up on many other things as well.As I was reading about the book online a lot of people had made comparisons to the HBO series Carivale which I never saw. I'm not sure that I could. I found several of the scenes of animal violence hard to read. One scene in particular still haunts me. In this scene two horses throats are slashed very violently.I am intrigued to see what this time period in the circus did look like which is why I am excited for the movie to be released. I am so excited for Hal Holbrook to be the olde Jacob character and I'm a big fan of Reese Witherspoon however, I do not quite agree with Robert Pattinson being cast as a young Jacob. When I read it I imagined more of a James Franco character. However, perhaps R.Patz can step out of his brooding Eddie the Vampire mode and do an excellent job.

The meticulous research on the book results in an interesting panorama of circus life where class divisions (i.e., performers don't sit with the roustabouts, clowns don't share their train car with others, etc.) eventually lead to internecine warfare at the end of the book.  There  is also jealousy, a three-way love triangle, prohibition, and oh yes, animal husbandry and abuse.  The picture the book paints of a prohibition-era circus train is vivid: smuggled moonshine from Canada, various misfits that magically come together during under the big top, the behind-the-barn striptease shows that went on in such circuses (funny, no one told me about that part when I was a kid reading about circus books!)  The namesake of the book is Rosie, the elephant that apparently only understands Polish.  Until that little nugget is unearthed, Rosie regularly receives the brutal end of a bullhook.  The only person between the bullhook and Rosie is the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, who suddenly finds himself ripped from an Ivy League university to a circus train when his parents die in an accident.  Fortunately, Jacob was studying to be a veterinarian and was only one examination shy of a degree.  But that does not matter to Uncle Al, the reprehensible circus owner who never saw the back of a head he could not hit.  The book has a 98-year old Jacob in contemporary settings reminiscing about his early life in the circus.  Jacob's \"escape\" back to a circus towards the end was a bit preposterous, I must admit.

The arrival of the circus next store leads him to reflect on his experiences working on a circus during the depression. I have never been to the circus but Gruen makes the days when the circus was still a big event come to life.Several things make this story stand out. First, instead of the usual format where the elderly person only appears to introduce a flashback, in Water For Elephants, the story alternates between Jacob's present life in the nursing home and his life as a young man in the circus. In the audio version, there are separate narrators for the younger Jacob and the older Jacob. This makes it easy to tell where you are and adds to the realism.At first I found myself wanting to get out of the nursing home and back to the circus, but by the end I cared as much about what was going to happen to the elderly Jacob and I did about learning the secret of his past. Even so, I thought the writing about the circus was especially powerful. Gruen's ability to evoke the world of the depression-era circus reminded me of Ann Rice's ability to make me feel that I am in New Orleans. She puts you in the menagerie with the animals, and Rosie, the elephant, is a character you won't soon forget.Finally, there is a surprise at the end, which leaves you feeling happier than you expected.This is a relatively short book that I think anyone who loves animals will enjoy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Memorable characters and story", "unixReviewTime": 1169856000, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2007"}

Most circus fiction is hardly worth reading, written by people who have no background in the business.  There was much play about Gruen's doing historical research for her novel at the Circus World Museum in Baraboo.  And there is a lot of interesting history in it.  But there is also some absolutely incredibly unbelieveable stuff, too.  Here are some glaring examples of what I consider to be the \"goofiness\" of the novel.Benzini Bros is portrayed as a 50 car railroad circus.  If you know anything about the railroad shows of the era depicted in the book this would have been second in size only to Ringling Bros.and Barnum&Bailey; Circus.  Most circuses of that time, even the smallest shows that traveled by trucks rather than by rail, had at least one elephant -- at least one!  But here is this 50 car railroad show without any!  And during the Great Depression elephants were not that hard to come by as times were tough and shows folded (went broke) and had equipment and animals, including elephants, for sale -- either by choice or by the Sheriff's gavel at forced auctions.  Just amazing that Uncle Al the owner had been unable to get an elephant until Rosy came along.Then Uncle Al  decides to blow his bookings and take his whole darn show out to where he eventually buys his elephant!!!  If there is any rule you don't break with a circus it is that you do not walk away (blow) your bookings, your route!!  If you had a circus the size of this one in the novel your daily nut (expenses) would be very great.  You cannot afford to blow your booked dates unless there was something very major like a foot and mouth disease outbreak that could cause the show to be quarantined for months.  Or the weather in the area you have been book is so bad, you cannot show because of flooding, heavy rains, snow, etc. Or you were following some other shows who have played the area and business is therefore bad.  But you just don't pack up your who show, blow booked dates, and head on out to get some new attraction!!  The way it worked (and still works) was that word of a show folding would be advertised in The Billboard, the show trade publication of the time, and buyers like Uncle Al or his agent would come out to where the defunct show's assets were going to be sold or auctioned off and then the bidding or buying would take place.  If you got your elephant, it was trucked back or loaded on to a railroad freight car and sent to wherever your show was.  But you didn't take your whole show and ship it out to pick up an elephant -- it's a wonder Uncle Al succeeded in building a 50 car show at all with this kind of management!Also I find it kind of strange that Uncle Al's show pulls up along side another, defunct show, and loads that equipment with his and Benzini Bros goes on its merry way.  And then at the end, Benzini Bros becomes the defunct show and another comes along side and loads the remains of Benzini Bros.  If you didn't know better you would think this is way shows would go out of business or be taken over by other shows.  I won't say this kind of thing didn't happen, but TWICE in the story?  Again, when a show folded, it was advertised in The Billboard as well as newpapers in the area it went defunct, and the buyers would come to buy the equipment, wagons, tents and exotic animals, etc.  Horses were not too difficult to sell as horse power was still a major factor on farms at that time.  There were dealers in used show equipment, William P. \"Diamond Bill\" Hall of Lancaster, Missouri being one, who bought defunct shows' equipment and animals, and then turn around and sell that stuff to other showmen who would put out a new show with it.I wouldn't have bothered to write this but for the fact that reviews I read of Water for Elephants made a big to do about its historical research and so-called accurate portayal of the depression era railroad circus.

ON TO THE BIG TOP MEAT AND POTATOES OF THIS EXTRAVAGANZA AS I DARINGLY ATTEMPT TO WRITE SUCH A REVIEW!!!Just so you know, I didn't think it was the latest and greatest masterpiece that everybody else did, but I didn't think it totally sucked either. Ok, you've been fairly warned, lest I rain on your precious parade, or enlighten it, whatever the case may be for the reader.To get things started, Jacob Jankowski is ninety. Hmmm...or maybe he's ninety three. Ok, ok, he's one or the other, OK?!!? But he's got a story to tell ya, and it ain't about Ringling. It is about one man who's left with nothing after his parents are killed, and he skips out on his vet finals. And that man hops a train, and walks into a hair-raising tale that only Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth can produce in a lifetime! And once he hops this train, he's nothing, but that changes rather quickly when certain authorities learn about his experience with animals, despite not taking his final exams.From there, Jacob is treated to a world of everybody and nobodies, and sometimes the big boys who might be jealous of their wives who married the wrong man. People are supposed to water at the mouth at the tasty treats a circus can only offer, and the men are more than likely to salivate at the \"cooch tent,\" where flesh runs rampant for a certain price. He is shown how cruel a man can be, and learns that to get what he wants out of this Main Attraction, he has to fight, and fight dirty, just like the low-lifes who run this show. And of course, there is Rosie, the lone elephant in this show, who isn't always understood, except by Jacob and his hopeful honey, Marlena. The question is, is there any easy way out of this?Unfortunately, Sara Gruen makes it a little too easy in the end, and what seems to be complex, turns just a little too easy for my taste. And in the very end, the ending is not only perfect, but Hollywood couldn't have conjured it up any better than Gruen did. I'm not sure I appreciate such an effort. I respect it, yes. The writing is spectacular. I just wish there was more to it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Big Top View Of One Man's Adventure/Fantasy For Wanna-be Ringling", "unixReviewTime": 1322006400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2011"}

It wasn't. We never went again. Even as a small child, I seemed to instinctively pick up on the abuse required to get wild animals to do what they do in the three rings of a circus. If nothing else, the sight of such wonderful creatures as elephants, lions, tigers, bears and various others, forced to do what they would not normally do but for cheap human entertainment, galled me. I loved animals. I loved them at a distance, to view them in either their natural habitat or through some telescopic lens that would keep the disruption of their lives in the wild at a minimum. For that reason, out of my respect for their wildness, I have avoided both the circus and zoos.Sara Gruen's novel, \"Water for Elephants,\" reinforced my decision. It is the story of Jacob Jankowski, both at age 23 and at age 90-something (he can't clearly recall, as he narrates the story in a series of flashbacks from the nursing home where he is at present wasting away his final days). He does not run away to the circus for the usual romantic reasons of seeking adventure and freedom, as it is commonly viewed. His parents have died in a car crash, and he finds himself without any inheritance, a veterinary student who must suddenly face the need to become financially self-sufficient. He can no longer afford to remain in school. Instead, he hops a train that carries all that is the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Through his eyes we come to see the behind-the-scenes reality of the circus.The star of this show, this book, is Rosie the elephant. She is the center point, and around her tangle the many eccentric characters: Uncle Al, the sadistic circus boss; August, the equally sadistic animal trainer, and his wife, Marlena, entrapped in the marriage, but quickly returning the love Jacob shows her and hoping for escape; and many others, circus hands and assorted circus characters, midgets and clowns and fat ladies and circus prostitutes, each with their own sad story.The story moves quickly, interspersed with fascinating black and white photos illustrating typical circus scenes of the day and adding historical credence. Gruen's writing skill is evident in keeping the pages turning and involving the reader, educating and tugging at heart strings as we witness scenes of cruelty against both human and animal. It is a not a literarily honed writing style, but an involving and entertaining one. We are moved, and we wish to know what happens to this array of colorful characters, even if the ending is quite predictable in its revelation of who murdered August and what action the aging Jacob will take at first opportunity to escape the nursing home.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Running away, to and from the circus", "unixReviewTime": 1218412800, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2008"}

I may like reading about rending flesh and crimson spouting arterial wounds, but even I couldn't get enough of the Benzini Brother's traveling circus and the rough lifestyle of it's crew.There are many sub-plots and side stories throughout this novel, but Gruen is a true master of tying them all together at the end.

What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th  Brigade, into the struggle.Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917.That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question here. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat.Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowdThe one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon.To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (sponsoring volunteers and ambulances). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings- yes.

To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life.For example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his?Further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists?Notable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story.This book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style \"Thee\" and \"Thou\" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me.This is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least.Interesting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Descriptive but depressing", "unixReviewTime": 1151798400, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2006"}

It even has some pleasant moments.  But ultimately, it's about the selfless nature of war---which, though Hemingway clearly intends us to admire the acts of sacrifice to which the war incites his characters, I think is the greatest condemnation of war.But Hemingway's portrayal of this theme is quite powerful.  He isn't always consistent, but he is about as consistent as it is possible to be about such a theme and much more so than most, which is of great artistic value.It's also generally very well written, much more so than (and something of a relief after reading) a lot of faux-Hemingway like John Steinbeck or Cormac McCarthy.  And I thought this was much better than the only other Hemingway I've read, A Farewell to Arms.  But there are a few passages that miss the mark, such as this almost comically bad sex scene: \"...They were having now and before and always and now and now and now. Oh, now, now, now, the only now, and above all now, and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. Now, please now, only now, not anything else only this now, and where are you and where am I and where is the other one, and not why, not ever why, only this now; and on and always please then always now, always now, for now always one now; one only one, there is no other one but one now, one, going now, rising now, sailing now, leaving now, wheeling now, soaring now, away now, all the way now, all of all the way now; one and one is one, is one, is one, is one, is still one, is still one, is one descendingly, is one softly, is one longingly, is one kindly, is one happily, is one in goodness, is one to cherish, is one now...\" blah blah blah.The mind-numbing repetitiousness of this \"description\" (if one can call it that) is especially unfortunate as it echoes another passage just a few pages earlier which is intended to have quite a different feel: \"...muck this whole treacherous muckfaced mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever. Muck them to hell together, Largo, Prieto, Asensio, Miaja, Rojo, all of them. Muck every one of them to death to hell. Muck the whole treachery-ridden country. Muck their egotism and their selfishness and their selfishness and their egotism and their conceit and their treachery. Muck them to hell and always. Muck them before we die for them. Muck them after we die for them. Muck them to death and hell...\"  It goes on like this at some length.But in the end, Hemingway affirms that there are \"pleasant things to speak of\": \"That is in Madrid. Just over the hills there, and down across the plain. Down out of the gray rocks and the pines, the heather and the gorse, across the yellow high plateau you see it rising white and beautiful. That part is just as true as Pilar's old women drinking the blood down at the slaughterhouse. There's no one thing that's true. It's all true.
