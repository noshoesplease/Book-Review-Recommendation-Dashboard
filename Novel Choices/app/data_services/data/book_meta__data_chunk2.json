{"asin": "0006499945", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "During the biggest snowstorm in the history of Philadelphia, the jury is out. The defense is confident of a verdict of not guilty, but then client Elliot Steere admits to his council that he is a murderer. Marta Richter does not take this revelation happily. In fact, she's so outraged that she wants her client's secret revealed no matter what it does to her career. Steere isn't about to let her blow his chances, and with powerful connections, money, and muscle, he works from his jail cell to silence Marta and her colleagues before the sequestered jury makes a decision. If readers like soap opera?type cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, a plot that reads like a TV script, and a little gory violence here and there, they will like this book. The characters are well thought out, but most often sequences of the story unfold implausibly, as when Marta hunts for clues in her client's house and boat. Attorney Bennie Rosato, the feisty character from a previous Scottoline novel (Legal Tender, LJ 7/96), makes an appearance here but is not very involved in the plot except for a \"save-the-day\" routine in the last few chapters. This is essential for readers already hooked on Scottoline, but don't start with this one when introducing her to readers.-?Shirley Gibson Coleman, Ann Arbor Dist.

{"asin": "0007101082", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The latest installment in the Wars of Light and Shadow series,  also the third movement of an inner story arc called the  Alliance of Light, well represents the vast and tangled plot  lines readers have come to expect from this prolific and popular  author. In the first book in the series, Curse of the Mistwraith  (1993), the half-brothers dark Arithon s'Ffalenn and blond  Lysaer s'Ilessid were set against each other by the eponymous  enemy, and now, 30-some years later, they're still going after  each other. This book's action begins in mid-flight during a  winter gale, with Arithon fleeing the walled city Jaelot, where  he's been imprisoned. With him he drags the unwilling peasant  Fionn Areth Caid'an, magically raised as his double to trap him.  Soon they join forces with Dakar the Mad Prophet (whose  prophecies have an erratic track record, though some have been  important), assigned by the Fellowship of Sorcerers to defend  our protagonist. Dakar has supplies and horses ready. Much  geography is traversed with many turgid pages spent attempting  to describe the indescribable effects of magic. Occasionally the  focus moves to Lysaer, with his large retinue of soldiers and  fanatic priests, who in private practice rituals as sorcerous as  the techniques of which they accuse Arithon. While fans have  compared this series to Robert Jordan's extended Wheel of Time  series, newcomers may be put off by the stilted language (\"The  guard captain's baleful stillness held threat\") and the mishmash  of plot.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Peril's Gate: Third Book of The Alliance of Light (The Wars of Light and Shadow, Book 6) (The Wars of Light and Shadow series)", "price": 5.69, "salesRank": {"Books": 1107887}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ca2VqL3xL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007101147", "0007217811", "0007102224", "0006482996", "0007217838", "0006482074", "0586210709", "B008SM18OY", "0586210695", "0061054682", "0007101112", "B005EP2URM", "0765326361", "0451451678", "0061054704", "0061057789", "0441432751", "0061054623"], "bought_together": ["0007101147", "0007102224"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007101147", "0007217811", "0006482074", "0586210695"]}}

{"asin": "0006751032", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Grade 4-8.  Elements of fantasy and fiction are woven into this fast-paced adventure. A student runs away from boarding school and meets an elderly lady, whom he later discovers is a ghost. She tells the story of another boy, Bertie, who grew up long ago in Africa and eventually became her husband. Lonely and neglected by his parents, he rescues an abandoned white lion cub and cares for it, gradually forming a close bond. After some years the boy's parents abruptly decide to send him to school in England and sell the lion. Bertie attempts to save the animal by returning it to the jungle, but it has lost its ability to survive in the wild and returns to the only home it has known. A French circus owner buys the lion, and the boy vows never to forget him. Twelve years later, Bertie fights in World War I and is decorated for rescuing wounded comrades. In a small French town he finally finds his lion, starving and near death, and the two friends are reunited. Heartened by the woman's tale, the student returns to school. This touching story is well written and emotionally satisfying. Readers will be drawn to this fascinating tale of a unique friendship between boy and beast. In addition to being a successful adventure story, the book demonstrates the value of character?of keeping promises, standing up for one's beliefs, and courage under fire.?Gebregeorgis Yohannes, San Francisco Public Library, CACopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Butterfly Lion", "price": 5.71, "salesRank": {"Books": 362043}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/719jsfbcgJL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0439591813", "0439796644", "0007230591", "0007107188", "0439636531", "0312593694", "1405233397", "0062006185", "0007267002", "1250039967", "043979661X", "0007267029", "0007182465", "0140384316", "1405256753", "0545460069", "0006745113", "0440865077", "0006753337", "0007339585", "0312606591", "140522925X", "0142411523", "0316085278", "1567924204", "0007476787", "0142501840", "0547328613", "0060525851", "0385742096", "014241011X", "0007230583", "0763652989", "1447207335", "076366040X", "1842704486"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0439591813", "0312593694", "0439796644", "1250039967"]}}

He got this job because of his love for travel, an interest he shared with the Archbishop. Together they went around the world, visiting such places as Australia, Africa, Scotland, New York, Alaska and China for their ministry. This book is the result of their journeys. Part memoir, part travelog, Waite's account is  humorous and witty. Hand-drawn illustrations at the beginning of each chapter capture the essence of the tale that is about to unfold. Asides or comments about the country they visited are thrown in at unexpected moments, adding a sparkle of delight to the story as when he emphaszies that not all 20 of the Primates they visited in Scotland arrived in the same taxi. But what makes this book so enjoyable is that the great friendship, affection, and respect that Waite and the Archbishop have for each other really shines throughout each tale.

{"asin": "0007107188", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Grade 5-8-A grandfather tells his grandson about the horrors of war in this story set during the Spanish Civil War. As a youngster, Antonito lived on a small farm outside the village of Sauceda. His father raised strong black bulls for the bullring, or corrida. The boy bonded with a newborn calf after its mother died, and in order to save it, he led Paco into the surrounding hills. While they were away, Franco's soldiers bombed the village. Leaving Paco behind, Antonito returned home, discovering the farm in flames. He escaped back into the safety of the countryside, but couldn't find the calf. Weeks later, suffering from hunger and exhaustion, he was found by his Uncle Juan, a Republican soldier, and nursed back to health. While recuperating, he heard a tale of a large black bull that chased down Nationalist soldiers, and he hoped that it was Paco. Years later, after he dreamed that the creature rested next to him while he slept in the forest, he awakened to discover hoof marks of a massive bull in the still-warm grass. Morpurgo's action-filled novel packs an emotional punch. The author gradually reveals the historical information and narrates the tale with the careful detachment of someone relating a story so awful that he can hardly bear to tell it. Ideal for reluctant readers, this book focuses on the loss and grief that grows out of times of war.Shawn Brommer, South Central Library System, Madison, WICopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Captain Mykkael thinks there is more to it than that, but because of his race and mercenary background, he isn't readily believed until civil war threatens to break out in Sessalie. Meanwhile, Princess Anja has fled far away, and Mykkael has to flee for his own life, overtake her, enlist help for her, and finally lead her to safety through the monster-haunted terrain of Hell's Chasm. Once a marriage is arranged into a family of potent sorcerers, Anja can see about saving her realm and family, while Mykkael takes vengeance on the demons who, many years ago, drove him from his homeland and love.

One bundle is titledThings I Know Are Trueand the other,Things I Must Not Forget. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to \"ask her mother to tell her about her life. For once, she would ask. She would listen. She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do.\"Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion ofThe Bonesetter's Daughtertakes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting:I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds.Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlierThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Bonesetter's Daughter", "price": 6.83, "salesRank": {"Books": 1409075}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514QpHx5Y4L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0143038109", "0143119087", "034546401X", "0062301675", "0142004898", "0143038095", "0399141146", "0062107313", "0385740352", "0689806167", "0802716830", "0399135782", "0804718156", "0143117645", "1451626657", "B002GJU418", "0679761640", "0155063863", "0399150749", "159463193X", "1554810272", "0062107321", "042524413X", "1565129768", "0307950395", "0812975227", "0520219783", "1455897213", "0812980549", "0679734775", "0802142443", "081299289X", "0399134204", "1400033411", "0812980352", "0812978684", "0156031515", "0679748261", "0061340405", "0451172027", "0684838230", "0449912701", "159448385X", "0385474547", "0618485228", "0486278077", "0385468865", "0156028352", "0809015803", "0486415872", "080411109X", "0811216020", "0812977610", "0385490445", "0807068977", "067976657X", "0802141900", "0027888304", "0689846177", "0679781587", "1493621890", "0345440315", "0679755330", "0451228146", "068484267X", "1442459964", "0143037749", "1400033438", "067976402X", "0060972459", "0375842209", "0812980530", "B0024FAOQ4", "0804194386", "0679721886", "0385721811", "0374529051", "0061950726", "0199552320", "0156033674", "B00817RYCG", "0544106539", "0573614636", "0156186004", "0061577073", "140003342X", "067973225X", "B00005JKGK", "0027888355", "080410753X", "0312119976", "B002CKYN8G", "159463176X", "0061730955", "0140186395", "0393960129", "1444123165", "0345522036", "0451530063", "0743270754"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0143038095", "0062301675", "0062107321", "0143119087"]}}

The killing temporarily stopped through the intervention of Hungary's regent, Admiral Miklos Horthy, under pressure brought by Raoul Wallenberg, a 31-year-old Swedish businessman from an aristocratic family. Wallenberg had been recruited by the War Refugee Board to attempt to intercede and save as many Jewish lives as possible. By bribing, hectoring and cajoling Hungarian officials Wallenberg managed to manufacture 4,500 Schutzpasses Swedish passports that allowed Jews, if they could prove any connection to Sweden no matter how dubious, to leave Hungary. He also negotiated a series of other deals with the Gestapo that made life easier for the Jews, even as the killings increased as the Russian Army advanced in early 1945. The final third of Smith's narrative examines the mystery of why Wallenberg was taken in custody by the Soviets in 1945 as a spy and was never heard from again. This familiar history is brought to life in vivid prose that at times borders on the imaginative was Wallenberg really inspired to his heroic actions after viewing the 1942 film Pimpernel Smith, based on the novel The Scarlet Pimpernel? and this important chapter of Holocaust history is conveyed with energy and a sound sense of historical context. Smith unearths no new material here although he does restate and reemphasize important historical facts such as the U.S. and British governments' negligence in not acting more quickly to save European Jewry but, in dramatic narrative form, presents a moving and compelling portrait of a man who acted when others did not.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Lost Hero: Raoul Wallenbergs Dramatic Quest to Save the Jews of Hungary", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5151XZGWBAL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 2929827}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

Also serving as a gazetteer,  biographical dictionary (of the departed only), and tour guide  (covering, for instance, Edinburgh's 223 subarticles and  Dundee's 11), the work runs A to Z from music theorist and abbot  Aaron Scotus (d. 1052) to Zetland (an alternative name of  Shetland). The entries have been revised and updated throughout,  and over 100 new pieces have been added, including those on  former United Kingdom Prime Minister Douglas Home; revered,  liberal Labour leader John Smith, who would have had Blair's job  if not for heart failure; the devolved Scottish Parliament; and  cloned sheep Dolly. One four-page series of maps sketches  rivers, mountains, and major towns, while another shows current  administrative boundaries. Four appendixes present the  Presbyterian churches and schisms; the dynastic trees for the  royal houses of Canmore to Stewart; those of the royal houses of  Stewart to Hanover; and French monarchs to 1848, Scots monarchs  to the present, and English monarchs to 1707's Union with  England.

The exclusion of the  long-prominent Scottish Labour, Liberal Democratic, and  Conservative parties reflects a serious bias, as all three have  played strong roles in Scottish governance since the 1707 Union.  The husband-and-wife editors, who work as writers and  broadcasters (John is also a historian of India), have produced  a fascinating book for research or browsing. Any general  library, and certainly those lacking the 1994 edition, will  welcome this standard reference, funds permitting. Highly  recommended.

{"asin": "0007111347", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"The thing about madness was, it just took so damn much energy, and it  was so thoroughly tedious in the meantime.\"  Master woodworker Rae Newborn knows madness intimately, with every bone, every pore, every particle of her being. At 52, with three suicide attempts, extended hospitalizations, the death of her husband and daughter, and a vicious attack behind her, Rae has come to Folly Island, far out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to rebuild her life by building a house:She would pull herself together, she would go and rebuild Desmond's house, she would lift his walls and dwell within them quietly all the rest of her days.  Everything that House was lay there waiting for her to take it up: House as shelter, House as permanence, House as a continuation and a legacy, comfort and challenge, safety and beauty, symbol and reality joined as one.Bequeathed to Rae by Desmond Newborn, a great-uncle she never met, Folly Island is lovely indeed.  But when Rae discovers Desmond's journal in the 70-year-old ruins of his house, she learns that Desmond had his own internal horrors to confront on the island.  As she labors in solitude, her prickly nature deterring all but the most determined of her would-be neighbors, it's not just her well-being that's at stake.  Rae must prove herself sane if she is to have any contact with her beloved granddaughter Petra. So when the \"skin-crawling feeling of being watched\" doesn't fade, she does her best to ignore it. But does paranoia have its roots in reality? And is Rae doomed to repeat her ancestor's tragic end?So effectively does King weave together past and present--the shrouded history of Desmond's life and death on Folly, and the tense, dusty, exhilaratingly panicky account of Rae's wrestling with old demons and new timber--that the future seems less important than the author might have wished.  In other words, the eventual unmasking of Rae's watcher pales in comparison to the gradual revelation of Rae herself within King's haunted and haunting narrative. But with such a strong character and such moodily lovely prose, readers shouldn't miss the denouement-driven trappings of standard suspense.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "Folly", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 5162376}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YATB2CJYL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0553382527", "0553586661", "0553574582", "0553578243", "0553574558", "0553578251", "0553588338", "0553573993", "0345531760", "0553588346", "0553386751", "0312427395", "055338676X", "0553383248", "0553386379", "0312427387", "1250055709", "0553381717", "0553590413", "055358667X", "0553807994", "0312427379", "0553386387", "B006QS0YQ0", "0345531787", "0553574566", "0553583417", "1250022061", "0312626908", "0312661681", "0553581058", "B0073FV7NY", "0312614160", "0425260453", "1250031125", "0312541163", "0062237195", "0553593617", "038534404X", "0553384805", "0553583387", "0062237187", "0312573502", "0345536746", "0385344023", "0553384791", "055357924X", "0312426216", "0143035304", "1250007348", "0062271601", "0062049615", "0061727717", "0061990639", "0547577400", "0553593625", "0061990647", "0345807154", "0312655479", "0547386060", "0312359675", "0547844174", "0062049585", "0345536738", "1476703558", "0316055433", "0553801910"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0553586661", "0312427379", "0553382527", "0553578251"]}}

{"asin": "0007116330", "description": "The argument of this set (see LJ 4/1/01 for a review of Volume  1) is that the two world wars were actually just one long war  with a confusing intermission and that the two parts of the  conflict have common themes, e.g., the problems of coalition  warfare, the experience of prisoners of war, and the shattering  experience of both wars, with increasing casualty rates and  strategic bombing really hitting hard on the Home Front. The  first volume focused on military affairs, while this follow-up  focuses on civilians and home fronts, the so-called People's  War. Thirty-five authors contributed 31 chapters about the  moral, cultural, and social experiences of the conflict,  covering topics such as British art and fiction, propaganda, the  Arab world, classical music, colonial India, and the  tribulations of German and Japanese women. Three chapters in the  last section discuss how this great world war is and should be  remembered, an issue that has been fought over quite a lot in  the last few decades. Excerpts from other works are used  liberally throughout. Each chapter is complemented by endnotes  and a short list of recommended readings, and the final chapter  is a bibliographic essay on the main sources used in studying  the wars. This set complements such histories as Earl R. Beck's  The European Home Fronts, 1939-1945 (H. Davidson, 1993).

A record of a classic road trip, Miller's tale is full of serendipitous adventures and thoughtful Christian reflection, offering an unusual mix of travel mishaps in a broken-down (and often breaking down) VW van; youthful, somewhat macho bantering between friends; and the sort of deep-thought wanderings into meaning and significance that are the meat of college-age existence. The book's strongest point is the way in which it conveys the character of Miller and his companion--two young \"Republican hippies.\" As we travel along with them, they can be fun, profound, annoying, hilarious and, at unguarded moments, surprisingly tender. Their insights are sometimes deep, sometimes naive, sometimes simple and sometimes just goofy. Their religious insights are similarly mixed in depth, but the two are remarkable and winsome in their aim at complete honesty. The narrator often allows himself to be portrayed in an unflattering light to faithfully recapture the experience.

In fact, all Christians stand with him before a watching world.How we respond to this challenge is the focus of Christ on Trial.

{"asin": "0007110642", "description": "Kindergarten-Grade 4-In true fairy-tale fashion replete with drama, romance, and redemption, a master storyteller conveys a timely (and timeless), compelling message about the frightening fragility of our environment, the awesome and restorative powers of nature, and the often-unconsidered consequences of an all-too-pervasive, superficial, \"gotta-have-it-now\" mentality. Lonely, unloved, and misunderstood, the gentle Beastman of Ballyloch lives alone on an island in his beloved silver lake, in harmony with the birds and animals, but reviled by the human inhabitants of the town, where he toils each day thatching houses, barns, and hayricks. As is so often the case in tales of this type, what lies beneath the sad young man's off-putting exterior is a person who is fine and untouched by anger or resentment. A brave and selfless act of kindness is the catalyst for a friendship, and this, coupled with his imposed intimacy with simple, natural elements, supplies the quiet Beastman with the information and intuition necessary to remedy an ecological upset that threatens the survival of all of Ballyloch. Foreman's pebbled watercolor-and-pencil pictures are jewel toned and as gentle and touching as the story itself, and their composition hints at the possibilities of reaching beyond boundaries-physical or figurative. This is an unassuming story with a powerful punch and a resonant reminder: \"There's truth in every fairy tale.\"-Kathy Krasniewicz, Perrot Library, Old Greenwich, CTCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Years earlier, King Elrius usurped his sister's rightful claim to the throne--an act that abrogated the divine protections set over his people, bringing plague and war to the land. There are those who would see the divine prophecies honored, however, and a warrior queen restored to the throne. So Tobin is disguised by means of dark magic that conceals her true gender with that of her twin brother, who was killed at birth, but not fast enough. He drew a single breath, which was enough to keep his soul earthbound and horribly angry. Tobin will indeed be queen, but only if she can be protected until adulthood from her insane mother, her demonic brother, and every evil wizard in the land.

{"asin": "0007114494", "description": "Entering its centennial year, the Times Literary Supplement, that British bastion of highbrow book culture, has a circulation of just 35,000. So it should not surprise anyone if a 600-page, painstakingly thorough history of the supplement generates sales somewhat more meager than that. This is something of a shame, for despite its wrist-cracking bulk and geological pace, this volume is stylishly written, affectionate and more entertaining than it has any right to be. May, a TLS contributor and longtime Times man, closely chronicles the supplement's tenuous start (it was originally issued to cover book reviews squeezed out of the regular Times by parliamentary reports) and frequent financial crises the TLS would inevitably be rescued in the nick of time by one high-minded millionaire or another. May faithfully traces the rise of such famous contributors as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, freed by anonymity (there were no bylines in those days) to write searingly vivid critiques. (Of one unlucky title Woolf wrote, \"You draw from it that sense of instruction in unimportant matters which you get by looking from the train window at a flat stretch of countryside.\") May is equally good following the uncertain early fate of works destined for immortality, like The Waste Land and Ulysses. The correspondence of hawk-eyed TLS subscribers, pouncing on errors in translations of Catullus, will delight those with a taste for the absurd. It is hard to imagine any but the most stout-hearted TLS reader undertaking this long journey from cover to cover, but American literary scholars will likely treasure this heroic record of a periodical that took the life of the mind more seriously than most.

Steeped in girlfriend-to-girlfriend attitude and style, Horne's funky and relentlessly positive prose (\"[Eve] was, in fact, a benevolent and switched-on sister....\") is liable to infuriate practiced occultists while proving irresistible to young people fascinated by or even just curious about witchcraft. Part memoir and part manual, the book offers snapshots of just about every part of a modern witch's practice, from casting spells and observing Wiccan sabbaths to setting up an altar and practicing \"skyclad\" (or nude)Anot to mention how to make magic with, for and during sex. Although this guidebook can safely be characterized as a lighthearted romp through the practice of witchcraft, it does contain some useful and well-organized reference material, such as a glossary of \"magickal\" herbs, a calendar of the witch's year and a full complement of easy-to-follow spells for love, money and so forth. Occasionally, ethical qualms silence Horne's ready tongue, leading to curiously unusable directives (as in \"Bitchcraft,\" the chapter on hexing, where she describes in graphic detail the preparation and abuse of an enemy's effigy, but primly refuses to tell you what to say while you're doing it). Experienced Wiccans and occultists will want to turn to more authoritative sources, but as it stands, this is an appealing introduction for the dabbler, the dreamer and other wide-eyed seekers of modern-day magic.

{"asin": "0007119267", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Considered by many to be one of the very best Agatha Christie mysteries, this macabre tale has lost none of its crisp intrigue since it was first published in 1940. Using a plot formula that has since become a mystery standard, Christie conveniently gathers all the characters in one hard-to-leave location, in this case, the Jolly Roger, a vacation hotel on the southern coast of England. One of the guests, a gorgeous, dramatic flirt, is strangled to death, and the famous detective Hercule Poirot who happens to be vacationing at the Jolly Roger, too sets out to solve the case. Each of the well-developed characters is suspect, and listeners will constantly be changing their bets as to whodunit. British stage actor Suchet, who many know as the definitive Poirot from the Public Television Mystery! series was an obvious choice for the reader of this production, having won an Audie award for reading Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1997. Suchet gives an outstanding and highly entertaining performance, obviously taking great zeal in the task of fleshing out Christie's colorful lot of characters.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Evil Under the Sun (Poirot)", "price": 6.64, "salesRank": {"Books": 2135091}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KV1rObouL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062073575", "006207377X", "006207394X", "0062074016", "0062073559", "0062073850", "0062073842", "0062073583", "0062073907", "0062073753", "0062073923", "0062074024", "0062074083", "0062073737", "0062073826", "0062073893", "0062073885", "0062073745", "0062073974", "0062073982", "0062073877", "0062073834", "0062073966", "0062073761", "0062074032", "0062073818", "0062073796", "0062073869", "1434404374", "0062074385", "0062073958", "0062073613", "0062073567", "0062074091", "0062073990", "006207380X", "0062074008", "0062073532", "006207363X", "0062074377", "0062094424", "0062073729", "0062074326", "0062074148", "0062073508", "0062073605", "0062073621", "0062073702", "0062073516", "0062074113", "0062073656", "0062073648", "0062073672", "0062074164", "0062073664", "0062073494", "0062073540", "0062073788", "0062074105", "0062073486", "1495950816", "0062094408", "0062073680", "0062074369", "0062094459", "0062073699", "0062074156", "0062073524", "0062074431", "0062074423", "0062094394", "0062073710", "0375851232", "006207413X", "0062074121", "0062073478", "0062074334", "1619493721", "0062094440", "0062074407", "0062251678", "0062074415", "B001KZOVJK", "0062094416", "0007121083", "0062074342", "0062094467", "B001KP2J44", "0425108589", "0062204572", "156478214X", "0486408787", "0486299287", "0030563518", "0440159229", "B005X5XI4C", "0152050787", "0312970072", "B005X5XINI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062073486", "0062073923", "0062074016", "0062073974"]}}

Her instructions are practical, too: if mace, cedar and nutmeg are hard to come by, burn lavender incense; if chanting \"skyclad\" (read: naked) doesn't appeal, wear a white flowing robe. This simplicity and pragmatism is especially important in light of Horne's personal theology, which with its elements of Hinduism, Greek mythology, astrology, Native American ritual and Hazelden self-help books is extremely ecumenical. Readers eager to explore the latest developments in self-improvement trends might find helpful mantras within and will likely be delighted by Horne's enthusiasm for her subject. It would take some real magic to convince the skeptics, however; but if anyone can do that, it's this mediagenic author.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Seven Days to a Magickal New You", "price": 5.98, "salesRank": {"Books": 1657621}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YNHHHWV3L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007121326", "0007136951", "0007141335", "0972952950", "0007103999", "0738715212"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006CDOREO", "0007121326"]}}

{"asin": "0007122241", "description": "Barnard, the surgeon who performed the world's first heart transplant, offers realistic common-sense advice. He recommends the old stalwarts regular exercise, eating a Mediterranean-style diet, not smoking and so on, but adds his own ideas as well. These not-so-obvious (and really quite fun) ideas include: enjoying regular sex, taking a three-week vacation every year, and getting a grip on one's emotional life. A German who resides in South Africa, Barnard also believes in herbs and mineral supplements as heart health boosters, supplements Americans have been slower to recognize. But while many of Barnard's tips may be helpful for everyone, the book is aimed primarily at men even though heart disease is a mjor killer of American women. For example, there's an entire chapter about male potency issues entitled, \"Take Viagra.\" Female sexual issues are addressed only peripherally. Likewise, there's a chapter on the benefits of drinking two glasses of red wine each day never mentioning recent findings linking alcohol with an increase in breast cancer in women. While it's certainly not Barnard's fault that most medical studies are performed with men as subjects, he does owe his female readers information as well. Still, his tips are direct and positive, and are generally easy enough to integrate into one's life.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "50 Ways to a Healthy Heart (Thorsons Directions for Life)", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CQJ15FMXL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 2560208}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassingThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King), and its charming precursor,The Hobbit. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another.Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.--Paul Hughes--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Lord of the Rings", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2095945}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510DQ2D1RJL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["054792822X", "0618126988", "0345518845", "0345449762", "0345325818", "0867094478", "0618056998", "0544045521", "0821571133", "0073379220", "1586170252", "0393926168", "0618257608", "089870202X", "0345345061", "0345339681", "0060598247", "0544174224", "0345357116", "0786474785", "083083480X", "0618126996", "0312566743", "0393312836", "0393925722", "0544164229", "B00003CWT6", "0743234928", "0441172717", "0547928211", "0060652934", "B005LXQLRW", "0545162076", "0156904365", "B00005JKZY", "0137171668", "0312652690", "0375826696", "0544442784", "0061992887", "0547928203", "074323491X", "054792819X", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HFFE8HE", "0486415864", "0312369816", "B000MUJCDY", "0553801503", "0486289990", "B005537IFW", "0375842209", "B00HWWUQWQ", "0439784549", "0743273567", "B0088MVOUC", "0553582011", "1484707230", "B00005JKZV", "0142437301", "0345391802", "0545670314", "0987003984", "0765323117", "037584631X", "0553212753", "0446310786", "0142402516", "0316769487", "0441569595", "0345535529", "0440237688", "0807014273", "0062024035", "1495238954", "0743297334", "0590353403", "0060652950", "0439136369", "0140177396", "0679785892", "0440180295", "0345453743", "0345538986", "055358202X", "1451673310", "0812550706", "159463193X", "0140449264", "1451626657", "1423199626", "0441627404", "0553213458", "0156030306", "0684803356", "0060850523", "0743246268", "0451524934", "0399501487"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0345538374", "0547928211", "054792822X", "0547928203"]}}

But with calm, unadorned prose, smooth pacing and the genial realism of her modest colored-pencil drawings, Kerr makes Katerina more than the butt of a joke. Yearning for a companion to share life in the town's pond, Katerina believes that the reflection she sees in a shiny car is actually the other goose of the title: One day that goose will come out, thinks Katerina. Then I'll no longer be the only goose on the pond. But a snowfall that comes between Katerina and the reflection makes her think that her beloved has escaped! The sight of a man carrying a goose-sized thing in [a] goose-sized bag convinces Katerina that her soulmate is the victim of a goose-napping, and she single-mindedly pursues the perceived culprit. In the end, not only does justice prevail Katerina foils a bank robber but true love does, too: as a reward for her bravery, the town acquires a dashing gander named Charlie. The story gains from the English village setting (the mayor appears in a ceremonial robe) and from the supporting role awarded a girl shown admiring her own reflection on the car's surface, she is the only one who understands what Katerina really wants.

{"asin": "0007116055", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "New to the U.S. but first published in Europe in 1992, Coelho's latest (following the bestsellingThe Zahir) is an old school parable of good and evil. When a stranger enters the isolated mountain town of Viscos with the devil literally by his side, the widow Berta knows (because her deceased husband, with whom she communicates daily, tells her) that a battle for the town's souls has begun. The stranger, a former arms dealer, calls himself Carlos and proposes a wager to the town: if someone turns up murdered within a week, he'll give the town enough gold to make everyone wealthy. Carlos ensures people believe him by choosing the town bartender, the orphan Chantal Prym, as his instrument: he shows her where the gold is, confides that his wife and children have been executed by kidnapper terrorists (remember: 1992), and that he is hoping his belief that people are basically evil will be vindicated. Chantal would like nothing better than to disappear with the gold herself and thus faces her own dilemmas. Add in corrupt townspeople (including a priest), sometimes biting social commentary and, distastefully, a very heavily stereotyped recurring town legend about an Arab named Ahab, and you've got quite a little Garden of Eden potboiler. But the unsatisfying ending lets everyone off the hook and leaves questions hanging like ripe apples.(July 3)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Only his second collection (the first wasDark Carnival, later reworked intoThe October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children.

Widowed Ellie is just starting to recover from the recent death of her beloved if domineering husband, Frank. Returning to her village after a three-week stay at her daughter's in London, she learns that poison-pen letters pointing to scandal at St. Thomas's Rectory have led to the reassignment of her dear friend and vicar, the Reverend Gilbert Adams, and the emotional breakdown of the fey Nora, the church organist. Ellie agrees to help try to find out who's behind the letters. One evening, Ellie investigates a light in the church, a view nicely depicted on the novel's atmospheric dust jacket, and witnesses a \"suicide\" that she alone considers to be murder. Dismissed by the local police, Ellie puts her own life at risk to seek the truth. Our smart and determined heroine must also deal with her late husband's imperious aunt Drusilla; her spoiled, self-centered daughter, Diana; and a new man in her life, the suspiciously smooth Roy Bartrick (\"There's something too devil-may-care about him,\" asserts a neighbor). Minor characters introduced in the first book, like the inimitable Mrs. Dawes, take on new depth. Readers will cheer as Ellie takes charge after a lifetime of deferring to the wishes and wants of others.

He  demonstrates how her concern with moral psychology and the  complexity of humans is better explored in her novels than in  her writing on existentialism. When first published in 1986 as  Iris Murdoch: The Saint and the Artist (Macmillan), Conradi's  was the first book-length study of Murdoch's fiction. It is here  reissued in a revised edition to accompany the publication of  Conradi's biography of Murdoch (LJ 9/1/01) and now joins fine  studies by Maria Antonaccio and Bran Nicol. Conradi reaffirms  his estimates of Murdoch's work while also taking into account  the novels she had subsequently published.

It may be a bit of verse to moisten the eyes ...When I&#x92;m in heaven Tell me there&#x92;ll be Christmases without the pain No memories that will not fade No chilled and sullen sense of loss That cannot face the festive flame Nor breathe excitement from the ice-cream air Tell me how the things that Christmas should have been Will be there for eternity in one long shining dawn For all of us to share I love the promises of Christmas.Then again, there is this &#x96; an &#x91;advertisement&#x92; from Plass&#x92;s spoof of a church newsletter:&#x91;How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news? The answer is &#x96; not very, if they haven&#x92;t had those ugly corns treated. Christian chiropodist.

The only possible cure is the Bhelliom, a lost, powerfully magical artifact that even the Elder Gods are hunting for. Here the members of the group search for Bhelliom themselves, in spite of rival search parties, church and mundane politics, war and an angry, evil God. Eddings's delightful style propels the reader along a well-crafted and carefully unfolding course, and even through the few places he falls back on cliches of the genre. His characters are satisfyingly drawn; Sparhawk, his friends Kalten and Sephrenia and their companions are complete individuals, and the minor players are distinctive.

Readers are first introduced to the Dalai Lama as a young boy via brief but candid reflections on his mother, the loneliness his enthronement engendered and his rigorous study regimen. These and other intimate details of his life, including his meeting with President Mao and his exile to India, are telegraphed through an accessible and elegant first-person narration. The latter part of the text is dedicated to the Dalai Lama's philosophies on an assortment of topics, including religion (\"All religions share a common root, which is limitless compassion\"); anger (\"If your mind is dominated by anger, you will lose the greatest part of your human intelligence: wisdom\"); and marriage (\"making love is alright, but for marriage, don't hurry, be cautious\"). A novice-friendly glossary of Buddhist terminology and a stunning array of stand-alone, full-color photographs round out the volume. Though His Holiness solemnly admits that due to political and historical reasons he may very well be the last Dalai Lama, his teachings, illuminated in books such as this, will undoubtedly continue to influence generations of individuals seeking enlightenment.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Spirit of Peace: A Fully Illustrated Guide to Love and Compassion in Everyday Life", "price": 14.66, "salesRank": {"Books": 2540079}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X2H2HEML.jpg", "related": {"buy_after_viewing": ["1594488894"]}}

{"asin": "0007141785", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review.One of the great delights of reading a novel by the likes of Ghosh or Salman Rushdie is imagining their dialogue emerging in the mellifluous tones of the Indian-accented English spoken by their characters. In this audiobook, narrator Bamji accomplishes that task with skill, credibly rendering the lilting flavor of subcontinental English and reveling in the musicality of Ghosh's tale, set in a remote sector of India. Bamji invests most of his resources into the rich, ringing cadences of Kanai, the translator and intellectual at the heart of the book. Kanai, a striver looking to pull himself up by his bootstraps, possesses a certain comic charm, and Bamji embraces the role with panache.

Charlie Maclean, Whisky Magazine  Independent-minded, witty, erudite, and on occasion, iconoclastic and downright bawdy, Hills is clearly obsessed by whisky and this makes him the ideal guide to this complex and fascinating drink. This excellent book is likely to remain the most authoritative in its field for a long time. Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk  This book is wonderfully written ... it educates in a very thorough and pleasing manner. Everything you need to know about appreciating whisky, technically and culturally, is here. Read it and you won't need another whisky book in your life. Gordon Haggarty, The List magazine  In this swashbuckling book, Pip Hills lays bare all the secrets of whisky from its chemistry to its culture. He goes straight to the heart of the matter with admirable dispatch, revealing how the communion of barley, water, peat and oak creates a spirit of unique complexity.

The Pastons began as peasant farmers, rose to the status of minor Norfolk gentry and strove mightily to improve their lot through the courts, business and marriage. In this multigenerational biography, Castor tells their story as a sweeping whole and allows readers to understand these people's mental world, one so alien to us and yet strikingly familiar in the most unexpected of ways. Much of their story revolves around the acquisition of land and how they tried (not always successfully) to keep it out of the hands of their sometimes violent neighbors. Castor, a history fellow at Cambridge University, nicely summarizes the complexities of 15th-century politics and culture without losing her momentum. Beautifully paced and splendidly retold, Castor's tale of one family trying to survive and thrive against the odds is popular history at its best. 8 pages of color photos, 1 map.(Apr. 11)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The many schemes he concocts prove ineffective, and the sad child heads home along the beach. When he sees a sea star washed up on the sand, he is happy at last to have a star of his own. While the boy's original plan is counterintuitive, the rest of his schemes hold true for what a young child might dream up. The stylized watercolor cartoons are droll and lighthearted, resonating well with the tone of the story. Pair this with Kevin Henkes'sKitten's First Full Moon(Greenwillow, 2004) to share some nighttime adventures at storytime.&ndash;Rachel G.

{"asin": "0007134495", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The story line may be familiar, but Clarke does a solid job of bringing to life the world of the Arthurian legends in this retelling of Parzival's quest for the Holy Grail. The story opens with a brief account of the adventures of Parzival's father, a war-happy knight named Gahmuret who forsakes his new bride to go in search of conflict and glory, only to be killed in battle. From there, Clarke shifts to the son's tale, alternating accounts of Parzival's initial encounter with the Grail with the lusty meanderings of Gawain, a knight whose desire for romantic adventures is just as strong as his yearning for battle and recognition. Parzival's first encounter with the Grail throws his family into temporary disgrace and, when a witch curses him for his folly, he must go back and find the Grail a second time to square his accounts with the magic-oriented morality of the medieval world. Clarke, a scholar who provides a lengthy and thoughtful afterword to fill in the blanks for modern readers who are unfamiliar with Arthurian culture, certainly knows his material as well as his audience. But the nature of the story limits him to a wearisome alternation between battle scenes and love conquests, the one intriguing exception being Gawain's adventure in a house of horrors called Castle of Marvels that is controlled by an invisible evil magician named Kilgore. The craft and research that are obvious behind the writing will ensure Clark an audience among aficionados of medieval fiction, but there's nothing compelling enough in this particular retelling to earn him a wider audience.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Parzival and the Stone From Heaven: A Grail Romance Retold For Our Time", "price": 12.45, "salesRank": {"Books": 1034772}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CKV3K6S1L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0140443614", "1846881145", "190699935X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0140443614", "1846881145", "0330324594"]}}

Although Mog dies on the first page (\"Mog was tired. She was dead tired.- Mog thought, `I want to sleep for ever.' And so she did\"), the cat stays around for the duration of the story in the form of a spirit, thinking that the family won't be able to get along without her. The family members are sad at first, but their attention is soon taken up with a new kitten that is afraid of everything. With the help of Mog, it learns to play like a proper cat, and to love its family and be loved in return. Satisfied that her former family is now in good cat paws, Mog's spirit flies up to the sky. Like so many other classic children's book characters, this feline seems frozen in time, cared for by children who never get any older and in a house that always appears the same, providing readers the comfort that accompanies familiarity. But young listeners who know Mog may feel as bereft as her fictional family, and the uninitiated may be taken aback by the abrupt death. The floating spirit in each of the color cartoon illustrations may elicit questions that require some thoughtful adult answers. Although this is an interesting exploration of loss, endings, and new beginnings, for Mog's loyal fans, saying good-bye to her is like killing off Clifford, the big red dog.Jane Marino, Scarsdale Public Library, NYCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Goodbye Mog", "price": 8.8, "salesRank": {"Books": 2223693}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RDFRX7Q0L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["000717134X", "0007171285", "076364563X", "0007171366", "0007117523", "0590100548", "0688115187", "0007193602", "0764117645", "0689871341", "0007171331", "0001360000", "1783440295", "0007171315", "0006640338", "0943432898", "0517572656", "B006CDNWPE", "155017584X", "1553377648", "0976472481", "0875167349", "0590417010", "0007347049", "0007347030", "B005Q6A9CC", "0007528086", "0007167059"], "buy_after_viewing": ["000717134X", "076364563X", "0007171285", "0007171331"]}}

{"asin": "0007137788", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Tinged with Buddhist notions of karma and reincarnation, Banks's (The Indian in the Cupboard) riveting tale of reprisal and redemption centers on a Chinese slave girl and her fierce, embittered master, the Scottish laird Bruce MacLennan. After a feud with a neighboring warlord results in the bloody deaths of his cherished wife and children, MacLennan sets in motion his plans for a huge fortress, complete with dungeon, and then decamps to the fabled land of China in search of adventure. Working as a hired fighter, MacLennan encounters young Mudan (Peony) and, on impulse, buys her as his tea slave. The child's presence begins to reawaken feelings of tenderness in MacLennan, which he does his best to squelch. In another, more conventional novel, this softening might be the start of the warrior's re-entry into the world of the loving; here, it is simply the beginning of a heart-wrenching struggle between compassion and vengeance. For her part, Peony takes scraps of happiness where she can, gleaning wisdom and courage from the teachings of the Buddhist soldier with whom MacLennan travels; some years later, when she accompanies MacLennan back to Scotland, she finds something like familial love in her friendship with a kind stable boy. As the novel moves toward its conclusion, it conveys a powerful message about the terrible price of unswerving revenge. A poignant epilogue offers a spark of hope, especially welcome after all the sorrow that precedes it.

{"asin": "0007152531", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A romance evolves in the wake of a domestic shooting in Kimmel's intelligent and compassionate debut novel, which brings two friends of one of the victims together in a small Indiana town. Amos Townsend is the male protagonist, a 40-ish preacher who counseled the late Alice Baker-Maloney as her frayed marriage degenerated into a fatal confrontation with her controlling husband, Jack. Amos remains tormented by his attraction to Alice and his inability to have prevented the tragedy. Meanwhile, bookish Langston Braverman has returned home after dropping out of her Ph.D. program following an affair with an academic colleague and subsequent nervous breakdown. The two clash after Langston's mother, AnnaLee, orders her to abandon her literary projects to care for Alice's two orphaned daughters; Amos accuses Langston of being unfit for the job when both girls continue to exhibit a bizarre variety of compulsive, religiously oriented behaviors. The girls' crisis continues to escalate, leading to a series of melodramatic scenes in which Amos and Langston are forced to confront their own demons. There are some winning moments as the protagonists move toward a romance, although things are hindered somewhat by the sluggish pace in the early going, as Kimmel (A Girl Named Zippy) meanders through scenes detailing smalltown Midwestern life and as she delves into the pasts of the two leads.

{"asin": "0007149832", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "[Signature]Reviewed byJess WalterThey are the \"frozen Chosen,\" two million people living, dying and kvetching in Sitka, Alaska, the temporary homeland established for displaced World War II Jews in Chabon's ambitious and entertaining new novel. It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007156588", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In his lively history,Evening in the Palace of Reason, James R. Gaines sets two remarkable--and remarkably different--historical figures on a collision course toward a single night in Potsdam in 1747: the composer Johann Sebastian Bach--\"old Bach,\" as he was called then at the age of 62--and the still-young Prussian king, Frederick II, already known as Frederick the Great after less than a decade on the throne. Having long employed old Bach's son Carl--a more celebrated composer at the time--Frederick summoned the father from Leipzig and challenged him, with an offhanded cruelty, to a public compositional puzzle designed to humiliate the great wizard of the waning art of counterpoint.Gaines is a pleasant guide through the incestuous patchwork monarchies of middle Europe, with a breezy tone fitting for a former editor ofPeople. (\"The Hohenzollerns were a funny bunch,\" he writes at one point.) But he is also a passionately learned student of the intricacies of the era's musical theories and the secret languages of its coded compositions. (One is thankful that he and his publisher resisted calling the bookThe Bach Code.) Gaines leads up to his pivotal encounter with a double biography of his two principals, told in alternating chapters. Bach's mostly homebound life, which left few documents for historians, is often no match for the grotesque dramas of Frederick's parallel story, which climaxes when his father the king forces Frederick to witness the execution of his best friend (and perhaps lover). The weight that keeps the two stories in balance is the genius of Bach's work, particularly the masterfulMusical Offeringthat he composes in response to the king's challenge. The encounter itself may not bear the full burden that Gaines wants to give it, as a clash between two epochal worldviews, the faith of the Reformation versus the rationalism of the Enlightenment, but the two life stories he so vividly describes make the journey there more than worthwhile.--Tom Nissley", "title": "Evening in the Palace of Reason", "price": 9.71, "salesRank": {"Books": 441278}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XBMB5C3NL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0375415297", "0007156618", "B00004Z1B6", "1597522775", "0393319563", "156563361X", "039304825X", "1591280109", "0800607929"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007156618"]}}

In this powerful, intimate story, journalist Smith sets out to find these men and discover how that experience changed their lives. Smith, a boy living in a nondescript California subdivision at the time of the Apollo missions and caught up in the endless possibility of space flight, journeys to the halls of power in Washington, D.C., and the backwoods of Texas in search of these mythical figures of American know-how. He finds Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon, still cool and confident, a plainspoken man who never let on how close that mission came to disaster. In Gene Cernan, the last man on the Moon, he finds an imperious, driven, highly successful businessman. If all of the men share one affliction, it's fame. Once at the center of the world's attention, these mostly ordinary men with some extraordinary gifts and luck have lived their lives being asked the same question&mdash;What was it like \"up there\"? In an artful blend of memoir and popular history, Smith makes flesh-and-blood people out of icons and reveals the tenderness of his own heart.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007149824", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "[Signature]Reviewed byJess WalterThey are the \"frozen Chosen,\" two million people living, dying and kvetching in Sitka, Alaska, the temporary homeland established for displaced World War II Jews in Chabon's ambitious and entertaining new novel. It is&mdash;deep breath now&mdash;a murder-mystery speculative-history Jewish-identity noir chess thriller, so perhaps it's no surprise that, in the back half of the book, the moving parts become unwieldy; Chabon is juggling narrative chainsaws here.The novel begins&mdash;the same way that Philip Roth launchedThe Plot Against America&mdash;with a fascinating historical footnote: what if, as Franklin Roosevelt proposed on the eve of World War II, a temporary Jewish settlement had been established on the Alaska panhandle? Roosevelt's plan went nowhere, but Chabon runs the idea into the present, back-loading his tale with a haunting history. Israel failed to get a foothold in the Middle East, and since the Sitka solution was only temporary, Alaskan Jews are about to lose their cold homeland. The book's timeless refrain: \"It's a strange time to be a Jew.\"Into this world arrives Chabon's Chandler-ready hero, Meyer Landsman, a drunken rogue cop who wakes in a flophouse to find that one of his neighbors has been murdered. With his half-Tlingit, half-Jewish partner and his sexy-tough boss, who happens also to be his ex-wife, Landsman investigates a fascinating underworld of Orthodox black-hat gangs and crime-lord rabbis. Chabon's \"Alyeska\" is an act of fearless imagination, more evidence of the soaring talent of his previous genre-blender, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winningThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.Eventually, however, Chabon's homage to noir feels heavy-handed, with too many scenes of snappy tough-guy banter and too much of the kind of elaborate thriller plotting that requires long explanations and offscreen conspiracies.Chabon can certainly write noir&mdash;or whatever else he wants; his recent Sherlock Holmes novel,The Final Solution, was lovely, even if theNew York Times Book Reviewsniffed its surprise that the mystery novel would \"appeal to the real writer.\" Should any other snobs mistake Chabon for anything less than a real writer, this book offers new evidence of his peerless storytelling and style. Characters have skin \"as pale as a page of commentary\" and rough voices \"like an onion rolling in a bucket.\" It's a solid performance that would have been even better with a little more Yiddish and a little less police.(May)Jess Walter was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award forThe Zeroand the winner of the 2006 Edgar Award for best novel forCitizen Vince.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007157738", "description": "Black comedy meets social satire meets British farce in this winning novel by the author of Man Kills Woman, which shows how one man's generosity can become the source of another man's insanity. Phillip, an ex-football (as in soccer) star and a vaguely hapless instruction manual writer, is best friends with couple Barry and Sean, who are so rich and nice that they shower Phillip and his family with lavish gifts-skiing vacations, rare Chinese carvings and priceless Venetian corkscrews. With each new present he receives, Phillip becomes more obsessed with finding the perfect return gift. Repeated failures leave him so overwhelmed by gift inadequacy (\"I had lost. I had been defeated utterly... I was the inferior man\") that his attempts at reciprocation begin to look more like revenge. A sketchy fellow named Carlo-whom Phillip meets in jail after a dinner party gone awry-feeds Phillip's anxieties, and soon Phillip is sneaking into Barry and Sean's home in the middle of the night to perform a \"creepy-crawly\": shifting around their personal possessions and inadvertently killing one of the chinchilla rabbits he'd given them as a gift. Flusfeder's delightfully spare prose makes room, too, for the search for cult hero and erstwhile Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett, with whom Barry is obsessed; movie world excesses, displayed by Barry and Sean's fancy friends; parenting anxiety; and lots of Taoist sex-though why Phillip's wife, Alice, remains eternally willing despite his near-psychosis is a bit of a mystery.

{"asin": "0007156634", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The son of a German mother and an Irish father, Hugo Hamilton grew up in Dublin in the 1950s wearing \"lederhosen and Aran sweaters, smelling of rough wool and new leather, Irish on top and German below.\" His family spoke both German and Irish, but English was strictly forbidden--even uttering a few words of the cursed language was enough to earn an often brutal punishment from their father, a staunch Irish nationalist. His father maintained that \"your home is your language\" and insisted that they be a model Irish family and an example for others to follow. Hamilton and his siblings were not even permitted to play with children who did not speak Irish exclusively--a particular problem in a country where English is the primary language. Ironically, he was taunted mercilessly for his German heritage and children jeered him with cries of \"Eichmann\" and \"Heil Hitler.\" He was even put on \"trial\" once by a gang of kids who sentenced him death by snowball firing squad. This confusing quest to discover his identity and to gain an understanding of his family history is at the heart ofThe Speckled People, a profoundly touching and beautifully written memoir.His parents' secrecy concerning their own pasts only exacerbated his frustration, forcing Hamilton to cling to fragments of information gleaned secretly from hidden photographs and buried family relics. Written from the perspective of a child, Hamilton captures his feelings of confusion, guilt, and fear convincingly and with much humor and insight.

Taking a ball of string to leave as a trail, he sets off with his squirrel friend, unaware that his other animal pals plan to surprise him by getting to the center first. Percy takes so long to complete his tasks, however, that the creatures fall asleep on a lion-shaped bench, and Percy plays a trick on them instead. It turns out that the joke is on all of them, though?the well-meaning squirrel has collected all the string, and they will have a difficult time finding their way out. The poem that preceeds the story foreshadows such a dilemma, and at the conclusion, readers are invited to help by choosing the right path on the large, fold-out maze attached to the back of the book. (It will be disappointing, of course, if previous readers have navigated their way out with crayon or pencil.) Butterworth's bright, watercolor cartoons depict mischievous, fun-loving animals set for a springtime caper.

Beyond those facts, historical opinion varies--some scholars regard him as a reformer, and others as a reactionary, a debate that inspirits Michael Turner'sPittthe Younger (2003). Hague's biography differs from Turner's by muting interpretive issues and amplifying the day-to-day events in a life permeated by politics. Pitt's personal life remains enigmatic, and Hague acknowledges Pitt's elusiveness even as he attempts to ascertain whether he was an alcoholic or a homosexual. More certain is Pitt's ability as a leader and orator of the House of Commons, an institution the author himself knows well; he was the Conservative Party's former debating antagonist of Labour leader Tony Blair. Hague's experience adds convincing power to his account of Pitt's career, explaining how he remained ascendant for so long. A thorough biography, Hague's work is also an able contribution to British parliamentary history.Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Sad, funny and poignant, it also provides a disturbing look at the British legal system in its too often arbitrary, casual -- and racist -- dealings with those who seek asylum.

{"asin": "0007154607", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Authors who write about the entertainment industry often extend promises of wit and edginess to attract an audience.Colors Insulting to Nature, bySaloncolumnist Cintra Wilson, delivers these qualities because it enters the fray not with a forgettably likeable protagonist predestined for a happy ending, but with an axe to grind. The object of Wilson's loathing is the \"ego-porn\" Hollywood that turns out formulaic story lines, making hapless, mediocre talents believe that their dreams of fame can somehow come true.The central mediocre talent in this book is Liza Normal, who first appears in the story as an adolescent auditioning for a spot in a commercial. Imagine the child version of the Bette Midler character inBeachesand you're about halfway to understanding the tragic gaudiness of Liza's persona--though of course she is a sweet girl underneath it all. The novel follows Liza into adulthood, bringing other vividly drawn characters, including her shut-in brother, Ned, her narcissistic, alcoholic mother, Peppy, and a sadomasochistic dwarf named DelVonn along for the ride. Liza's cringingly funny attempts to win fame as an actress-singer never stop--and neither does Wilson's railing against the logic-corrupting, \"ultimately demoralizing\" messages from film and television that Liza has ingested from infancy. Will our heroine ever turn her life around and figure out that The Media made her do it? Will Wilson succeed in breaking free of formulas, or end up undercutting her own message with a fairy-tale ending?

{"asin": "0007155395", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In classic psychoanalytic style, Phillips strips our lives down to the fundamentals to illustrate the delicate balance between sanity and insanity. Sanity, he notes, \"has never been a popular word, or indeed... a condition one might write a book about.\" Madness, on the other hand, is dramatic and all too visible. We have psychiatrists, neurologists and researchers dedicated to studying and treating madness, but not even a quantifiable definition of saneness. Deftly guiding readers through historical and literary uses of \"sane\" and \"mad,\" Phillips, a British psychoanalyst (On Flirtation), cites Thomas Carlyle, R.D. Laing, Melanie Klein, D.W. Winnicott and Richard Dawkins, among others, to illustrate the stark absence of a definitive definition of sanity. InHamlet, for instance, Polonius uses the word \"madness\" to describe Hamlet's inventiveness and eloquent intelligence: he admires Hamlet's madness. Phillips examines the presence and essence of madness in all aspects of modern life in intriguing and disturbingly frank chapters on the chaos of raising children, the turmoil of adolescence, sexual appetites and the pursuit of wealth. His arguments, both thought provoking and provocative, may affect future definitions of sanity and madness, and readers are left with a fresh awareness of what it really means to be sane.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Holman entered the navy at age 12, at the height of the Napoleonic Wars. When blindness overcame him, Holman was an accomplished sailor, and he engineered to join the Naval Knights of Windsor, a quirky group who only had to live in quarters near Windsor Castle and attend mass for their stipend. For many blind people at the time, this would have been the start of a long (if safe) march to the grave. Holman would have none of it and spent the bulk of his life arranging leaves of absence from the Knights in order to wander the world (without assistance) from Paris to Canton; study medicine at the University of Edinburgh; hunt slavers off the coast of Africa; get arrested by one of the czar's elite bodyguards in Siberia; and publish several bestselling travel memoirs.

Threaded into her family's crisis is her ongoing internal elegy on the exclusion of women from the literary canon, which she transposes to mean her daughter's exclusion from humanity. Reta wonders if her daughter has discovered, as she herself did years before, that the world is \"an endless series of obstacles, an alignment of locked doors,\" and has chosen to pursue the one thing that doesn't require power or a voice: goodness.In her own writing, Reta reaffirms her own sense of self, as well as her sense of humor. As her theoretical reflections on modern womanhood play counterpoint to her unwavering sense of creating a home and keeping her family together, Reta's smarts and fears form a wonderfully coherent narrative--a life worth reading about.

{"asin": "000715612X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Joel Lingeman, the protagonist of the third novel by Washington insider-cum-novelist Merlis (American Studies), is, at 45, a man in full, with a high-profile job as a health policy adviser to Congress, a long-term lover and a tightly knit circle of like-minded friends. Still, he is unable to avoid the eternal question of \"what if?\" His mind wanders off medicare and HMOs, drifting back to his high school years, yearning for another chance to correct his juvenile mistakes, to chart a different course in life. Change, however, is thrust upon him when Sam, his lover of 15 years, leaves him for a younger man. Lingeman's world implodes, and he is thrown back into the scene of Washington's gay bars, seeking reaffirmation and companionship. His sudden change of status propels him into an obsession with one of his boyhood fantasies, a model in an ad he saw in a magazine as a child. Lingeman is so engrossed by this ephemeral man that he misses a more obvious and tangible potential lover. Cleverly, Lingeman's career echoes his romantic life, as he finds himself disgusted with the opportunism and cynicism of Washington politics. Merlis's staccato style, stinging and insightful, puts the reader inside Lingeman's head as he treads the fine line between fantasy and reality, between the superficial and the meaningful. Merlis is able to move from describing a certain assistant's dress as one \"an organ grinder might have chosen for his monkey\" to the deepest contemplations of commitment, couplehood and the importance of candor. He creates a protagonist with broad appeal, proving beyond doubt that the personal is political and vice versa.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Man About Town: A Novel", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 2836757}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4101Tfu0inL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312242883", "0395689929", "1596910429", "0312186754", "0062196243", "155152502X", "1593501188", "0394751019", "0743272714", "1608209121", "0312303726", "1608197034", "1609530896", "1620401886", "0312263031", "1608208400", "0964109964", "0446563137", "0299283402", "1608207064", "B007IV4ODS", "1590211618", "0802139027"], "bought_together": ["0394751019"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0395689929", "0312186754"]}}

Percy the park keeper spends his day off relaxing with his animal friends. The first illustration depicts the man lounging against an old tree trunk, chewing on a long stem of grass; his anthropomorphized friends recline in identical positions. Everything is fine until a jumping game gets out of hand and a young rabbit falls into an abandoned well. Percy rushes to help, throwing her a long rope and instructing her to tie it tight. Not understanding what she is supposed to do, she ties it to the log she's sitting on and proceeds to find her own way out. The man and his helpers strain and pull until finally out pops the log-but no bunny. The following page folds out and out again, revealing a long line of befuddled animals-and a little rabbit holding onto the end. This fold-out page is clever but will not hold up well in a library.

{"asin": "0007149425", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This biography of country rocker Earle begins with him skipping a 1992 meeting with record execs to sign a potentially career-reviving, multimillion-dollar record contract. Instead, he sold his airplane ticket for $100 and went to score crack in the slums of Nashville, beginning what Earle calls his four-year \"vacation in the ghetto.\" It's a brilliant opening hook, and St. John (Walkin' After Midnight) never lets the reader go, breezily guiding through Earle's wild childhood (he dropped out of school after the eighth grade and was living on his own by 16), his five tumultuous marriages, his many run-ins with the law, his restless wanderings through the American South and Mexico-and a quarter-century of addiction to booze, cocaine and heroin that finally ended after some jail time in the mid-1990s. By talking to many of Earle's closest friends, family and former wives, St. John manages to demythologize a man whose life often threatens to overshadow his music (unfortunately, however, she herself doesn't spend much time on Earle's actual recordings). She interprets Earle's death wish simply as an attempt to break away from his middle-class upbringing. Like his literary heroes Hemingway and Kerouac, he courts disaster to fuel his writing. As St. John writes, \"It was no accident that his life was a series of belief-beggaring dramas; quite often he was the cause of them. Consciously or unconsciously, he cultivated his own legend.\" Springsteen may have been the \"consummate chronicler of welfare-line blues,\" she writes, \"but Steve had lived the life.\"Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Hardcore Troubadour: The Life and Near Death of Steve Earle", "price": 13.06, "salesRank": {"Books": 444197}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41p0JzOJahL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0547754434", "B00B89WZCS", "0879308427", "B000002N61", "0618040269", "B001QZEHEI", "B004N5DHSK", "B000002NIC", "B00005V7G1", "0769284493", "B000006YE9", "0618219242", "B00064VQYE", "0618820965", "B00006IUH6", "B000000EXP", "B00000I427", "B0013UL4EC", "0816519064"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009D76K00", "B000006YE9", "B000002NIC", "B00817OTPG"]}}

{"asin": "0007161328", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Billed as a novel of \"overlapping relationships,\" Whitbread-winner Cusk's evocative latest, with its tenuously connected sections, feels more like a short story collection linked by theme and a few shared characters. Cusk (The Country Life; Saving Agnes) unites her tales via her characters' lonely, isolated conditions and the knotty relationships between parents and children&#x97;from Kristy, an imprisoned mother-to-be who gives birth in the back of a squad car in \"Confinement,\" to Mrs. Daley, an unhappy, controlling woman whose need to establish herself as a victim trumps her ability to find or give happiness in \"Mrs Daley's Daughter.\" Cusk's vision of contemporary relationships is a lonely, wintry one, in which people's inner landscapes dominate. This makes for gorgeous, languorous writing in places, but it also restricts the view: the landscapes are so rich with pathos that there isn't always enough room for the range of human emotion so essential to prose that relies on thought instead of action. In \"The Sacrifices,\" a married woman who never had the baby she desired visits her childhood home, now occupied by strangers, and fantasizes about returning to her old room: \"I would sit on my bed as the afternoon turned outside the window to night. I would wait for them to call me down.\" This passivity runs throughout the book, as characters tend toward rumination rather than deed. But as readers come to the end, the lives of Cusk's characters begin to tie together hauntingly. This is not life in all its messy complexity, but a mannered, poignant portrait of the treacheries of domestic life.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007163665", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this nervy, self-conscious debut novel, British writer Thirlwell airs the unspoken anxieties and confusions of two lovers, crafting a talky deconstruction of a relationship. Moshe is a character actor, \"the sketchy one, the sardonic one, the oddball cool\"; Nana is an architecture student, \"tall, thin, pale, blonde, breasty.\" It is the off-stage narrator, however, who is the book's most notable presence, with his countless digressions, \"simple\" theories, lengthy explanations and bossy directives. Despite his repeated assertions that the book is not about sex (\"sex isn't everything\"; \"sometimes I think that this book is an attack on sex\"), Moshe and Nana are constantly experimenting (\"oral sex, use of alternative personae, lesbianism, undinism\"), though their experiments usually end in failure. This is true of their biggest experiment, a three-way affair involving Anjali, an Anglo-Indian actor friend of Moshe's. Reading Thirlwell's novel is similar to watching a film with the director in the room, guiding the viewer through every scene. While many of the resulting narrative flourishes are clever or endearing, their humor and intellectual cachet wear thin as the ratio of window dressing to substance tips heavily in favor of the former. Still, Thirlwell's brave attempt to debunk the primacy of sex (while elaborately describing his characters' hapless pursuit of it) is surprisingly convincing.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Politics: A Novel", "price": 7.59, "salesRank": {"Books": 2979350}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61qBNiOp1dL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0956569234", "B005Q6BMTQ", "0670015970", "0099513226", "0374137226"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0956569234"]}}

{"asin": "0007163061", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "British historian and Emmy Award-winning BBC producer Cadbury (The Last King of France, etc.) chronicles seven great engineering feats of the 19th and early 20th centuries: the Great Eastern, the largest ocean-going vessel of the mid-19th century; the London sewer system; the U.S. transcontinental railroad; the Brooklyn Bridge; the Panama Canal; the Hoover Dam; and, least known, Scotland's Bell Rock Lighthouse. Cadbury pays special attention to the visionary, sometimes almost delusional men who were the human catalysts for these breakthrough accomplishments. Her choices are good ones, as the fascinating personalities at the center of these endeavors include corrupt manipulators, selfless crusaders and arrogant self-promoters, all of whom share a preternatural single-mindedness, which is at the core of their successes. Cadbury also describes the human costs that success required, often of the founders of these enterprises and invariably of those who moved the steel, dug the holes and poured the concrete. The cumulative loss of lives on these projects was in the thousands, and Cadbury is unsparing in her descriptions of the ways death occurred. Men were boiled alive in a boiler malfunction on the Great Eastern; blown up, scalped or mutilated while working on the transcontinental railroad; and entombed in concrete while building Hoover Dam. But the book is not a social commentary about the reckless disregard of 19th-century industrialists; it is, rather, dedicated to the human ingenuity displayed in these battles with a stubborn and capricious natural world. Readers who enjoyed the challenge of building the 1893 World's Fair in The Devil and the White City will find much to revel in here.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Road it's: never pass a part of the world with your name in or on it. Thus this genealogist-cum-pint-swilling adventurer embarks on a frolicsome, drunken globe-trot to uncover the roots of all things McCarthy and in the process expose what it means to be a McCarthy and, by extension, to be Irish. It's a lively, lusty quest; McCarthy travels like a Renaissance explorer with a film director's lens. In Tangiers, he finds a Moroccan McCarthy who puts a unique spin on the term \"black Irish.\" He takes in America's premier Irish event, New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade (which he finds more Celtic and American than Irish and not a little Scottish besides). Next stop: Tasmania, the penal colony where so many Irish were sent by the British government. And how could he resist a visit to the town of McCarthy, Alaska, population 18? The ultimate mocking tour guide with acerbic charm, McCarthy delivers scathing critiques of people and places, himself included. His droll and often drunken existentialist view proffers a unique (and distinctly Irish) perspective on the world that is part history, part McCarthy's Law. Some may be put off by his frequent references to drugs, sex and overimbibing, but McCarthy is like a character out of contemporary Irish literature, a traveler on a winding road surrounded by life's imperfections yet finding them beautiful despite it all (especially after a pint or two).

The heroine is thirtysomething Cath, a smiling, punning, do-goodingbien pensantwho has somehow ended up in the vicious purlieus of Wall Street, dealing billions with the great white sharks of high finance. This unfeasibly high-powered employ contrasts sharply with Cath's home life. She's married to a man 25 years her senior: \"sweet Bailey, dearest Bailey... optimistic where I was pessimistic, enthusiastic where I was distrustful.\" This marriage is not perfect: as Cath mordantly observes, \"marriage is awful in its nearness. Yoked together, bound, in a three-legged race with no finishing line.\" Nevertheless Cath and Bailey, in their May/December way, have found a kind of happiness. Then, horribly, Bailey is diagnosed with Alzheimer's....Three chapters in we learn this terrible truth, and the rest of the book concerns Cath's desperate, affecting, sardonic, resolute ways and means of dealing with Bailey's rollercoaster ride to the inevitable--or even worse. It's not an easy journey; this is not the easiest of books.

{"asin": "0007156642", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor for \"committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons.\" Wilde's story became a cautionary tale for homosexuals in Victorian England; in the century since, he has come to be celebrated as a martyr of the gay struggle for recognition. This volume, with an introduction and commentary by Wilde's grandson, Holland, publishes for the first time the unabridged transcript of the first of the three infamous trials that resulted in Wilde's destruction. The irony, as Holland's introduction makes abundantly clear, is that Wilde courted his imprisonment, suing his inamorata's father, the Marquess Queensberry, John Douglass, for libel when Queensberry left a card for him at the Albemarle Club that read, \"For Oscar Wilde, posing sodomite.\" Wilde might have been best served by tearing up the card and forgetting it; instead, he pressed charges. But Wilde's riskiest step was treating the witness stand as a theatrical stage. When a prosecutor asked him if he had kissed a certain young man, Wilde joked, \"Oh no, never in my life. He was a peculiarly plain boy.\" With that one flippant comment, Holland's text suggests, the die was cast. But the transcript and Holland's judicious notes also reveal how ill-served Wilde was by his counsel. Some of the same letters that were later used to convict Wilde were introduced by his own lawyers in this first trial as evidence. The general reader might find a work that condenses all three trial transcripts into one narrative, such as Moises Kaufman's stage adaptation, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, more accessible, but this volume is invaluable for the Wilde enthusiast, the legal scholar, the champion of human rights and the student of English literature.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde: The First Uncensored Transcript of The Trial of Oscar Wilde vs. John Douglas (Marquess of Queensberry), 1895", "price": 12.58, "salesRank": {"Books": 1077361}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kn7-WiabL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["080505894X", "0394554841", "0465044387", "0375702326", "0805059156", "0300173806", "1605983810"], "buy_after_viewing": ["080505894X", "0486401464", "0394759842", "0786707011"]}}

{"asin": "0007162219", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A baffling array of science books claim to reveal how the mysteries of the universe have been discovered, but Simon Singh'sBig Bangactually delivers on that promise. General readers will find it to be among the very best books dealing with cosmology, because Singh follows the same plan he used in his brilliantCode Book: he puts people--not equations--first in the story. By linking the progression of the Big Bang theory with the scientists who built it up bit by bit, Singh also uncovers an important truth about how such ideas grow.Death is an essential element in the progress of science, since it takes care of conservative scientists of a previous generation reluctant to let go of an old, fallacious theory and embrace a new and accurate one.As harsh as this statement seems, even Einstein defended an outmoded idea about the universe when an unknown interloper published equations challenging the great man. Einstein didn't have to die for cosmology to move forward (he reluctantly apologized for being wrong), but stories like this one show how difficult it can sometimes be for new theories to take root. Fred Hoyle, who coined the term \"big bang\" as a way to ridicule the idea of a universe expanding from some tiny origin point, strongly believed that the cosmos was in a steady state. But Singh shows how Hoyle's research, meant to prove the contrary, added evidence to the expansion model.Big Bangis also a history of astronomical observation, describing the development of new telescopes that were crucial to the development of cosmology.

Whether one is in harmony with the world or not depends upon one's relative emotional and spiritual health. For this reason, the core teachings of Buddhism have always emphasized various forms of mind training. InTransforming the Mind, based on an edited series of his lectures, the Dalai Lama provides a succinct overview of the basic techniques of spiritual development in Tibetan Buddhism. He introduces several aspects of mind training, combining the insights of traditional scholarship with his personal warmth and humanity.The book begins with a lucid account of the basic teachings of Buddhism--the nature of the human predicament and how it can be overcome. Then two key aspects of mind training involving the development of altruism and insight are described. This is essential, since Buddhism teaches that true mental transformation requires a sense of responsibility for others, together with the attainment of insight into the dynamic working of the human psyche and the world. Included in the book is the short traditional text on mental transformation, which the Dalai Lama used to structure his illuminating presentation of Buddhist practice. As an added bonus, the book concludes with a message for the millennium, giving the Dalai Lama's views on the role of Buddhist-inspired ethics in this newly dawning era.Though not aimed at complete beginners, this book will appeal to readers who are seriously committed to bringing about change in the world through developing their own spiritual capabilities, whether they are Buddhists or not.--Stephen Hodge, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Transforming the Mind: Teachings on Generating Compassion", "price": 14.66, "salesRank": {"Books": 1327561}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P8B9MHT2L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1594488894", "0743453360", "1571746099", "0743290461", "1401931847", "1559391979", "0316930938", "1573228834", "1559390735", "B00B1KZRJ2", "0805090215", "0743463021", "072253955X", "1594480923", "1594487383", "1559392401", "1590306937", "0140196129", "1559391537", "0767920813", "161429156X", "014219607X", "1608829928", "0553381059", "0007100973", "0307407802", "1571746285", "1559392592", "0861711734", "0007332475", "0060987014", "1559390611", "1416565841", "1559392533", "0767903692", "1594487898", "1559390328", "0062018094", "0861716280", "1571746811", "155939403X", "0722532105", "0060616881", "1466480033", "1559392282", "0060617225", "0861714407", "0861711823", "0062508342", "1401940587", "0500289611", "0861711238", "0062267434", "0553351397"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1594488894", "0743453360", "1416565841", "1571746099"]}}

{"asin": "0007163649", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. The cycle of photosynthesis is the cycle of life, says science journalist Morton (Mapping Mars). Green leaves trap sunlight and use it to absorb carbon dioxide from the air and emit life-giving oxygen in its place. Indeed, plants likely created Earth's life-friendly oxygen- and nitrogen-rich biosphere. In the first part, Morton, chief news and features editor of the leading science journal,Nature, traces scientists' quest to understand how photosynthesis works at the molecular level. In part two, Morton addresses evidence of how plants may have kick-started the complex life cycle on Earth. The book's final part considers photosynthesis in relation to global warming, for, he says, the Earth's plant-based balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is broken: in burning vast amounts of fossil fuels, we are emitting more carbon dioxide than the plants can absorb. But Morton also explores the possibility that our understanding of photosynthesis might be harnessed to regain that balance. Readers should persevere through (or skim) the more technical discussions in the first part, for what follows is a vast, elegant synthesis of biology, physics and environmental science that can inform our discussions of urgent issues.(Nov. 4)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While roaming in the Special Collections Room, Neil encounters a talking teddy bear that blackmails him into traveling back to the Blitz in London in order to rescue his four-year-old brother, Josh, who had been tricked by the magical bear. As Neil and Ted maneuver around London, meeting American soldiers, local people, and even a German spy, a demon breaks loose from the museum into the past as well, and, suddenly, in order to save the future and change the past, they must recapture it. Jarvis tries to do too many things with this story and ends up not doing any of them well. Time-travel fantasy and family drama are mixed in with horror-the descriptions of those killed by the demon are very graphic-and a dose of Nordic mythology and sentimentality. Hints are dropped about the origins and identities of the museum's owners, but only readers with a background in mythology will understand the references to weaving that they make. The plot involving Josh is dropped almost completely until the book's end when he magically reappears, and making one of the female characters an ambitious German spy pushes the whole thing just too far over the edge.Lisa Prolman, Greenfield Public Library,Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Woven Path (Tales from the Wyrd Museum)", "price": 1.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 5062386}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FP1AZA0GL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0816770069"]}}

But Levy, film critic for thePortland Oregonian, goes beyond the glitz to see Rubirosa as a product of a particular time and place: dictator Trujillo's Dominican Republic. Like many Trujillo intimates, Rubirosa was well paid for his loyalty, not his labor. By the 1960s, when Rubirosa crashed his Ferrari in Paris's Bois de Boulogne, he was an anachronism&mdash;at that point, even wealthy men were trying to have careers of some sort.

The author, who has studied and written about what she calls \"high sensitivity\" (The Highly Sensitive Person), states that this is a personality trait that occurs in 15% to 20% of the population. Although HSCs tend to be \"empathetic, smart, intuitive, careful and conscientious,\" they are also easily overstimulated and require informed parenting in order to prevent temper tantrums, stress illnesses and the avoidance of pleasurable group activities. Aron offers helpful advice that will assist both nonsensitive and highly sensitive parents through all stages of their child's development from infancy to adolescence. For example, since HSCs have great difficulty with change, it is necessary to prepare them gently so that they do not feel powerless during transitions. According to the author, there are four basic strategies that will help an HSC to become a happy adult: parents should foster their child's self-esteem, try to reduce the feelings of shame HSCs may develop because they are different, employ only mild positive discipline and learn how to talk positively to teachers and friends about their HSC so that interactions will be productive.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Highly Sensitive Child: Helping Our Children Thrive When the World Overwhelms Them", "price": 9.39, "salesRank": {"Books": 2415584}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iqxWZgReL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0966074521", "0553062182", "0767903374", "1452566925", "1572243961", "0767903366", "B005DI6RA6", "0060739665", "0757316123", "0897935098", "0446674990", "1439200327", "0767914929", "1618210823", "1451663889", "0060527188", "1601632843", "1452578567", "156414948X", "1591473144", "0060932929", "0060930438", "0595098002", "0312329784", "0761135243", "006073602X", "1593635443", "0060952407", "B001TBYOWE", "B005BU3EO8", "0071596909", "0415800749", "0738211850", "0143115340", "0060923288", "0767903358", "1593634900", "1466263539", "1572245751", "0684838656", "0062270451", "0307352153", "0345493966", "1462510078", "0399531653", "0399537694", "0553386697", "0983625689", "1433813394", "1575421763", "0312615523", "0786883146", "1575423162", "1433803186", "0307341607", "1433801345", "B00E9WIC14", "B006HT2T20", "1575423464", "1416583009", "0770436595", "0807563811", "B00000JN49", "1897238452", "0375826319", "1433804506", "0142410586", "B00000DMF5", "1608828840", "0807588970", "0978507517", "0807594733", "B003AH6NII", "155971624X", "B000090W81", "1592403352", "1611800587", "B0000YWF5E", "1591478057", "B00DGK6HGM", "B00005BW71", "B004X8GJPA", "B00EJAEWW4", "B006H28VOW", "B0038QQ7KA", "0545019230", "1414313632", "0393342212", "B001GAQKKW", "B003AYEHIO", "B00ESMT5CK", "1889140430", "B0092ZW6FG", "B002BRSCJ6", "B00364E1DE", "B000XSAZUO", "1933054395", "006074104X", "B0037Z8DEK", "0802403476"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0553062182", "0060739665", "0966074521", "0767903366"]}}

With his smallish stature, knobby  knees, and slightly crooked forelegs, he looked more like a cow pony than a  thoroughbred. But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote,  \"was mostly in his heart.\" Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who  became a cultural icon inSeabiscuit: An American Legend.Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner  Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that \"the day of the horse  is past\"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who \"had cultivated an almost mystical  communication with horses\"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck  when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube.  Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of \"team Seabiscuit,\" from early training  sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to \"Horse of the  Year\"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also  describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern  journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great  thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas  in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as  his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle  while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose  chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San  Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering \"Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em,  you old devil!\"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes  on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and  taunted them with his blistering speed.Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue (\"His history had  the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow\"; \"The California sunlight  had the pewter cast of a declining season\"), Hillenbrand has crafted a  delightful book. Wire to wire,Seabiscuitis a winner.

Despite the well-planned diagrams and agreeable drawings of grinning pets, the clinical, deadpan humor sometimes falls flat, and the concept of animal-as-machine seems contradicted by the presence of mini-pups that apparently monitor the canine controls.

For young Ella, the heroine of Gail Carson Levine's Newbury Honor-winning debutnovel, this is more than a fanciful wish; it could be a matter of life or death. Placed under the spell of a blundering fairy, she has no choice but to go through life obeying each and every order--no matter what the consequences may be. \"If you commanded me to cut off my own head, I'd have to do it.\"Eden Riegel (As the World Turns,Les Miserables) uses her youthful, energetic voice to lead the listener into a familiar world of fairy godmothers, wicked stepsisters, and handsome princes. But this imaginative retelling of the Cinderella story comes with a welcome twist. Instead of a demure heroine patiently awaiting a prince who will carry her off, this Ella is a feisty ball of fire with the courage and ambition to take matters into her own hands.Riegel narrates in a youthful, energetic tone that is perfectly suited to Ella's character. Her voice adds charm and immediacy to a wonderful story already rich with excitement, adventure, romance, and mystery.

From  Julius Caesar to the 10th-century Arabs; from Mary Queen of Scots to \"Alice and  Bob\"; from the Germans' Enigma machine to the Navajo code talkers in World War  II, Singh traces the use of code to protect--and betray--secrecy. Moving right  into the present, he describes how the Information Age has provided a whole new  set of challenges for cryptographers. How private are your e-mail  communications? How secure is sending your credit card information over the  Internet? And how much secrecy will the government tolerate?

Here 12-year-old Zeinab is given by her father to Napoleon in a Muslim marriage that is never consummated and later finds brief happiness in a marriage with chief engineer Nicolas Conte of the French Scientific Commission. Disavowed by her father, she is saved from being executed for treason by her pregnancy, then sheltered by the aristocratic philanthropist Sitt Nafisa the White. Serageldin recounts the devastation wrought on her home country by its successively more abusive occupiers&#x2014;the French, followed by the Turks and Albanians, who executed the leaders of the long-prominent Mamluke military caste&#x2014;in the context of the politics of the times.

{"asin": "0007175337", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"Out of all the cultures in the world... true Islamic values, as embodied in the Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad, most closely resemble American values.\" So asserts Hasan, who has devoted much of her adult life&#x97;she is not yet 30&#x97;to combating anti-Muslim prejudice. As in her first book, American Muslims, she passionately argues against stereotypes and in favor of an Islam that sounds a lot like Reform Judaism or liberal Christianity. This is the Islam she knew growing up in Pueblo, Colo.&#x97;an American girl who looked Chicana and attended a Catholic school. Hasan's version of Islam would have appealed to America's founders with its advocacy of human equality, religious tolerance, property rights and self-improvement. It harmonizes just as well with 21st-century America's spiritual inclinations: it is nonjudgmental, inclusive, open-minded, diverse, experiential, emotional and even feminist. \"The Prophet Muhammad is personally responsible for the greatest advancement of women's rights in a single time period,\" she writes, noting that no Islamic justification exists for abuses such as female genital mutilation or stoning adulteresses; these stem from ancient patriarchal traditions that pre-date Islam. Not all American Muslims welcome Hasan's interpretation of their faith or appreciate her enthusiasm for America (she recounts several experiences with such antagonists and suggests that they move to an Islamic country). Unfazed, she counters: \"I'll make my own tradition&#x97;one that embodies my own American Muslim ethnic culture.[Hasan's italics]\"-\" This is do-it-yourself American religion at its most appealing.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007163630", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this lively chronicle, historian Francis (Transcendental Utopias) offers a compelling portrait of the decline of Puritan ways in the late 17th century and the ascent of a secular spirit in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Although devout, Samuel Sewall (1652&ndash;1730) turned away from an early religious vocation to pursue a career in public office and married into the colony's aristocracy. He found himself catapulted into the limelight as one of nine judges who condemned the alleged witches of Salem in 1692. Francis calls this the turning point in Sewall's life and work. Never convinced that the condemned women were guilty, Sewall felt remorse; in 1697 he walked into a Boston church and offered a public apology, the only one of the three judges to do so. As a result, he was rebuffed by his social circle. Yet, according to Francis, Sewall's courage is magnified by his taking a stand he knew would result in ostracism. In his later years, Sewall wrote tracts opposing the colonists' treatment of Indians and slaves. Francis beautifully captures not only Sewall's personality and significance but also the shifting times in which he lived, when it was becoming no longer possible to \"see the world as a simple allegorical struggle between... good and evil.\" B&amp;w illus.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

InFeather Boy, Nicky Singer traces a character-defining sequence of events  in the life of a boy named Robert Nobel. He is often the butt of classroom jokes  and pranks--and being called Norbert No-bottle all the time isn't much fun  either. He secretly wants to be somebody. To have a voice. To have friends.Robert's participation in the Elders Project changes his life forever. Selected  members of his class are chosen to visit and interact with the elderly residents  of Mayfield Rest Home--to find out about their lives and to \"counter ignorant  attitudes about such senior members of society.\" Robert's main attacker,  classmate Jonathan Niker, considers the old people \"vegetables,\" but Robert's  own buried true-life personality is slowly unearthed by Edith--a prickly  resident who singles him out. Edith is considered quite mad; she's haunted by  the unhappy memories of her son's tragic death at her previous home, Chance  House. As Edith's condition deteriorates and the Elders Project heads towards  its conclusion, Robert is drawn deeper and deeper into her story. His visits to  the derelict Chance House become more frequent, and one fateful trip to sleep  there overnight as a dare with Niker heralds the first step on Robert's own  journey in search of his real self.Feather Boyis more than just a story about bullying. It's about finding  your voice, shouting from the rooftops about something you believe in, refusing  to back down, helping a friend, and never giving up.

{"asin": "0007173415", "description": "The pseudonymous Mimi Smartypants, a Chicago writer and editor, started an online diary in 1999, leading to a book contract from HarperCollins UK and now publication in the U.S. She doesn't pretend this is a great literary feat; to her, it's like someone offering to publish your grocery lists. \"You wouldn't even call yourself a  'writer' because dude, grocery lists? Come on.\" So don't expect heavy-duty style or even plot from this likable 30-something&mdash;she's just blogging, alright? Overall, Smartypants is something of a hypochondriac, with frequent passages on her colds and other ailments, like her \"exquisitely painful leg cramps.\" Sometimes she drinks too much, with hangovers that tie into the hypochondria. The narrative's quirky images (e.g., too much caffeine makes the author's spine feel \"like a glass harmonica\") and odd suggestions (e.g., try hydrating those compressed-foam animals in a mouthful of beer) certainly give pause, as do her occasional word inventions (e.g., making muffins, she describes those \"large lipomas of butter\" trapped in the hand mixer). Nothing beats Smartypants's discussion of how the \"pseudo-Aztec design\" on the Tostitos bag resembles a uterus with ovaries.

{"asin": "0007181639", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Those who fear the dry and impenetrable prose of many political essays need have no such reservations with this selection. Indian author Roy (The God of Small Things) brings a novelistic readability and immediacy to her impassioned critiques of imperialism, the corporate media and their \"neo-liberal project\"&#x97;what she describes as \"the medium of those who have power and money.\" Her unequivocally critical look at the Bush administration&#x92;s policy in Iraq will likely lead American readers to label her as either brilliantly astute or strongly anti-American. Still, she carefully differentiates between governments and their people. In \"Instant Mix Imperial Democracy,\" she congratulates Americans for standing up to their government: \"Hundreds of thousands of you have survived the relentless propaganda you have been subjected to, and are actively fighting your own government. In the ultra-patriotic climate that prevails in the United States, that&#x92;s as brave as any Iraqi or Afghan or Palestinian fighting for his or her Homeland.\" In the same talk, Roy delivers a scathing critique of the current state of democracy: \"The project of corporate globalization has cracked the code of democracy. Free elections, a free press and an independent judiciary mean little when the free market has reduced them to commodities on sale to the highest bidder.\" In addition to observing problems; Roy suggests non-violent solutions&#x97;boycotts, protests and open discussion. Regardless of whether one agrees with her ideas, Roy crafts articulate and convincing arguments that deserve their place in any debate on globalization, democracy or Iraq.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007190360", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This sprawling conspiracy theory traces the influence of ancient Egyptian and gnostic ideologies concerning a dualistic, Manichean cosmos prefiguring the earthly order, knowable only through secret, magical lore from medieval Catharism to the French vogue for pharaonic monuments and deities, the astrologically suggestive layouts of Paris and Washington, and the Statue of Liberty (the \"Isis of New York\"). The conventional explanation for the historical recurrence of gnostic themes and Egyptian iconography&mdash;that people peruse old texts and art works and adapt their ideas and symbols to new purposes&mdash;strikes Hancock and Bauval (coauthors ofKeeper of Genesis) as inadequate. They discern the millennia-long plot of a shadowy gnostic \"Organization\" working through usual suspects like the Freemasons, whose hidden hand they see influencing everything from the French Revolution to the founding of Israel. The authors draw eye-glazing webs of connections between historical coincidences&mdash;some intriguing, others tenuous and forced&mdash;to insinuate a \"not altogether impossible\" master plan. But their proposed conspiracy never gels. Its guiding philosophies, Christian gnosticism and pagan occultism, don't really mesh, and its agenda seems no more coherent than a perennial opposition to the alleged intolerance and obscurantism of the Catholic Church. The book's crude anticlericalism and conviction that culture propagates by conspiratorial, not intellectual, processes make it a distortion of the gnostic mindset.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007175175", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This classic Seuss title stars a happy-looking quadruped from the shores of Lake Winna-Bango who has the most amazing antlers and the kindest disposition. Alas! Everyone, but everyone, takes advantage of his generosity, and before long he has three-quarters of the animal kingdom nesting in the convenient perches atop his head. (\"They asked in a fox, who jumped in from the trees, / They asked in some mice and they asked in some fleas.\") You might think someone would take pity, but nobody seems to like an oddball, and all Thidwick gets for his trouble is complaints and contempt.

{"asin": "0007190042", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The latest addition to McDermid's dark and gritty police procedurals, which have become even more popular thanks to the BBC America TV programThe Wire in the Blood, finds the series' usual main protagonists, psychologist/profiler Dr. Tony Hill and Det. Chief Insp. Carol Jordan, joined by DI Don Merrick, elevated from the ranks of supporting players. Topping their docket are two serial killers: a child molester who murders and hides his young male victims and the Creeper, who tortures and slays prostitutes using the identical modus operandi of a killer firmly ensconced in a mental facility. McDermid's strength is the engaging and multidimensional characters he creates on both sides of the law. The book was a finalist for the CWA's 2004 Gold Dagger Award, but this audio abridgment is more interested in story than in character. There are several effective set pieces, notably an undercover sting that goes bad, resulting in the abduction and torture of a novice policewoman, and Merrick's life and death struggle with the child predator. At these points, Doyle's competent but undistinguished performance rises to the challenge. But by trimming away the novels' strongest element&mdash;its vibrant characters&mdash;the abridgment highlights the novel's weakest element: the less than credible sequences leading to the identity and capture of the Creeper.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007194161", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Clevenger's debut novel is a well-crafted but underplotted character study of a brilliant, damaged man who struggles with mental illness and substance abuse as he bounces in and out of prison and a series of hospitals around Los Angeles. Most of the novel takes place in the latter setting; some tense early scenes pit protagonist John Dolan Vincent against a psychiatrist known as \"The Evaluator,\" who probes Vincent's psyche to see if his recent overdose of muscle relaxants was really a botched attempt to cure his migraine, as Vincent claims, or a suicide attempt. The twist is that Vincent has checked into the hospital under an assumed name; after each of his previous overdoses he has changed his identity to avoid being placed in a mental hospital. The psychiatric interview provides a decent vehicle for telling the story of Vincent's difficult family life and his decision to use his mathematical talent to assist a murky criminal network. The trouble is that Clevenger has little to offer to push his story forward besides Vincent's efforts to protect Keadra, the woman he falls in love with during a hospital stint, from the thugs who are trying to track him down. Clevenger is a solid writer who does some good work when it comes to creating a noirish atmosphere and smart, compelling characters, but the pace is uneven at best. The quality of the writing warrants a follow-up effort; hopefully, Clevenger will know what to do with his characters the next time around.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Contortionist's Handbook", "price": 40.68, "salesRank": {"Books": 3245616}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGEVFN54L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1596921021", "1931561753", "0140289011", "0312352190", "1250035953", "0307275833", "039333807X", "0307476537", "0670881759", "0385533039", "1613641621", "0684853159", "0393319296", "076792830X", "0976631156", "0375703764", "1605427349", "0670889202", "0385720920", "0375713344", "0374532885", "0385722222", "098554550X", "0140291873", "1400079373", "1940430046", "0393327345", "0679781498", "0679743243", "0385722192", "1400030927", "0394726413", "1931561826", "0307476898", "0679735771", "067978148X", "0393329003", "0425173305", "0385415443", "0394569024", "0307744868", "0957091907", "0802140149", "0982628145", "0393313964", "0375706682", "1933929065", "0804139024", "1400032814", "0140186255", "1933929014", "0307275841", "1933929693", "038533348X", "1250036658", "0679723226", "0307887448", "1555975771", "0316066524", "0099427869", "0061147966", "0316777730", "1592404308", "0061944890", "0547572298", "1400032822", "0312924585", "0679720200", "B000GP0O0U", "1400032717", "0060532246", "0394539931", "061595409X", "0981502741"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1931561753", "0140289011", "0312352190", "0393327345"]}}

Logan MacRae police procedural (after 2006'sDying Light), the Aberdeen police, on the trail of a serial rapist, catch Scottish sports hero Rob Macintyre stalking tarted-up Woman Police Constable Jackie Watson, MacRae's live-in lover. Macintyre's arrest ignites public sentiment against the police, stifling the investigation. Meanwhile, a second case drags MacRae into the local s&amp;m scene, where he gets an unexpected education in the sordid details from his red-faced assistant constable, and then he has to track down an eight-year-old killer. The one thing the three cases have in common is that nothing is what it seems. MacRae bounces back and forth among them, yanked between two cranky, childlike detective inspectors demanding overtime and loyalty.

In \"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\" Gilbert Wolfscale struggles with drought and debt to hold on to the ranch that has been passed down in his family for generations, driving off his wife and two sons, who have no interest in continuing the legacy. Many old-time ranch owners in this territory are women, and they face similar struggles: in \"The Trickle Down Effect,\" Fiesta Punch hires local ne'er-do-well Deb Sipple for a long-distance hay haul, with disastrous results. Proulx does leaven her tales of hardship and woe with a dry humor, and she doesn't forget to tackle the misguided romance sought by newcomers to the land, as in \"Man Crawling Out of Trees,\" in which a retired couple from the Northeast find that the quiet truce of their marriage can't survive encounters with the resentful locals. While none of the stories in this collection approaches the sweep and wholeness of \"Brokeback Mountain\" (the standout story fromClose Range, and soon to be a major film), and other pieces are little more than whimsical sketches (sometimes with a touch of the magical), they paint a rich, colorful picture of local life.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chan (whom Quan created for her Salon online column) is a \"successful\" (read: expensive) prostitute who spends more time listing her favorite clothes, restaurants and cosmetic tips than even Bret Easton Ellis did in American Psycho. In between $400-per-hour quickies at exclusive hotels, Nancy and her happy hooker pals Jasmine and Allison attend sex-industry activist meetings and debate the sinister reappearance of Jack, a former john who now appears to be obsessed with Allison. Nancy whines about this and her deepening relationship with her commitment-minded boyfriend to her shrink, also revealing how she plunged into prostitution as a teen. The novel has neither a substantial plot (Nancy dithering over whether to marry her dream boyfriend and get out of the life) nor sex appeal: Nancy's descriptions of her sensual encounters, be they professional or personal, are about as erotic as a stereo instruction manual (\"always do a few extra Kegels afterwards\"). Fans of Quan's online column may enjoy the continuation of Nancy's X-rated soap opera, but first-time readers may be put off by her snobbishness.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 3846167}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uoZUJq5pL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1402214642", "1926745493", "1597775940", "0060014164", "0753821605", "1400053544", "044654082X", "0743289757", "0978094409", "1409113841", "1592573681"], "buy_after_viewing": ["044654082X", "B007MXCXVC", "1580051693", "1597775940"]}}

Having seduced a silly Austrian princess on the ship bearing the body of Maximilian, the ill-fated emperor of Mexico, back home to Trieste in 1867, Harry eludes the offended Austrian authorities by seizing the chance to become the British envoy on a mission to rescue a group of European hostages held by the mad Abyssinian king, Theodore. (When Whitehall neglected to respond to the polite letter Theodore wrote Queen Victoria, he took captive a few hundred unfortunate foreigners.) This now obscure expedition, which made headlines in its day, provides the kind of sardonic history lesson fans have come to relish. Allusions to adventures not yet published tantalize, notably those to do with Flashman's role in the U.S. Civil War. Fraser has nibbled at the edges (Flashy was there for John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1995'sFlashman and the Angel of the Lord), and one can only hope that the next volume does more than simply mention such iconic names as Gettysburg.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That experience, recorded in Hayden's One Child, which became a TV movie, is updated in this deeply moving sequel. It picks up with Sheila as a sullen 13-year-old bouncing between juvenile facilities and her father's \"care.\" As Hayden renews her ties to Sheila?first at a clinic, then through informal contacts?the girl's outbursts and foul-mouthed sexual preoccupations betray a desperate craving for a sense of belonging. An inspirational testament to the healing power of love, this authentic tearjerker resonates with drama. There is no storybook ending: Sheila, with an IQ over 180, forgoes college to work for McDonald's; an epilogue finds her 10 years later as a branch manager at McDonald's and an articulate, stable woman.

{"asin": "0007196091", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The charts are full of stories of childhood abuse now, Elliott writes, and speculates that fans of childhood abuse literature want to be shocked at the start of the book, crying in the middle and exultant at the end. Her account (Jane Elliott is a pseudonym) adds little that is fresh to the genre beyond that her [s]eventeen years was an astonishingly long time to have been systematically abused. A good part of this true story of a four-year-old girl who fell into the power of a man for whom evil was a relentless daily activity is devoted to the shock&mdash;graphic detail of her stepfather's physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Some readers will feel for Elliott as she continues to be victimized by a thoroughly amoral lunatic head of an incredibly dysfunctional family; others may find that the explicit detail teeters perilously close to the pornography of violence and of sexual degradation. While Elliott's stepfather is eventually sentenced to 15 years, little exultancy follows until Elliott decides to tell her story and achieves British bestsellerdom. Elliott's account, written with Crofts, makes fascinating reading as one wonders, in page-turner fashion, whether anyone will stop this man from terrorizing his stepdaughter, her mother, her siblings and the entire neighborhood. The vagueness of time and place, however, raise disquieting questions about reality.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007192932", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Illes, the author of three previous books on magical spells, has compiled a lively and chatty reference on witches. The work is arranged topically, and there is a helpful index. Individual articles within the topic chapters sometimes haveseereferences as well. After a long introduction discussing several different and sometimes nearly mutually exclusive definitions of witches, chapters cover plants, animals, food and drink, magical beings, famous people in the magical world, the creative arts, witch persecution, and more. Chapters--or sections within the chapters--includeA-Zentries that range from a few paragraphs to a few pages. An extensive bibliography and a list of Internet resources complete the work.Illes focuses most strongly on Western European witchcraft practice and history, but she gives considerable attention to Asian, African, Mesoamerican, Caribbean, and South American practice as well. The creative arts chapter is up-to-date enough to discuss the Harry Potter phenomenon as well as many films, television programs, and other arts-related representations. Illes' take on the representation of witches inThe Wizard of Ozis in solidarity with witch practice.The book is long and could have used editing both to trim the text and to correct errors in spelling and grammar. Illes tends to overwrite when she feels passionately, and an editor would have helped with this as well. The horrors of witch persecutions--which continue in many places to this day--do not require overwriting, as William Burns shows very well inWitch Hunts in Europe and America(Greenwood, 2003), which is not in the bibliography.Academic libraries with extensive witchcraft collections may wish to consider this volume if only for the bibliography. Public libraries seeking a popular reference work on witchcraft could do much worse than this one.
