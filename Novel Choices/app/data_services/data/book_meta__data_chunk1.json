{"asin": "0004724542", "description": "Operating under the premise that the World Wars I and II were actually parts of the same huge conflict, 38 historians have written 33 chapters comparing the two wars. There are chapters on occupation and genocide, war in the air and undersea, POWs, casualties, and the experience of killing. The chapters on the national and military leadership (e.g., Churchill and Lloyd George, Hitler and the Kaiser) offer the most direct comparisons. The biggest difference, of course, was the relatively stable (but incredibly deadly) trench warfare of 1914-18, unlike the 1939-45 period, which was notable for its immense geographic scope, the number of troops involved, and mobile operations (land, air, and sea). The aim of this book is \"to demonstrate the diversity of personal experience in the two world wars,\" primarily in the uniformed services. The next volume will cover the national experiences of countries and the role of civilians. There is no bibliography, but notes are found at the end of the chapters. There is a glaring lack of maps, which would have been helpful. Suitable for the military history collections of both public and academic libraries. Daniel K.

Fiercely self-abnegating (as she has been all along in America bringing up Nicole with only the help of a nightclub entertainer lover), Anna vanishes altogether, leaving Nicole to be appropriated by her British relatives, presented at court, pursued by many young men including the son of her mother's first husband, until she turns her back on wealth and position to marry a young man who takes her to Boston, dies in WW II, while Anna at least finds happiness with a Russian from her childhood. At the end Nicole returns to Lynmara as its countess and to an old age as strong-minded as her mother's. . . . A long soft read for several successive evenings.

{"asin": "0006165699", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "What pleasurable admiration one derives from the fact that in an age, and an area, where most writers become burnt-out cases, Eric Ambler - who after his classic beginnings and less remarkable middle years and books - is now getting better and best. Burnt-out cases is a deliberately chosen term since this new novel takes place in Graham Greene-land - one of those desolate little Central American coffee republics where even the palm trees are \"like tired, untidy women.\" Here Dr. Frigo (which means frozen meat) assumes an uncommitted, spectator stance after the assassination of his father (was he a real liberator or just an opportunist?) twelve years before, ignoring his mother's treason theory and her desire to have Ernesto (his given name) as an avenger. But he just goes about his doctoring and has an affair with one of the most charming creatures met in a long time - Elizabeth, an artist, also a Hapsburg of direct descent six times removed from the Empress Maria-Theresa of Austria, Elizabeth who makes unsettling insinuations and only too direct historical referrals to the Hapsburg past which might be pertinent now. Particularly since Ernesto is asked, forcibly, to attend Villegas, his father's successor and candidate for a new takeover backed by international off-shore oil interests. But apparently there is something very wrong with his patient, more than his \"abdominal inconveniences\" - there's his slurred speech which when finally diagnosed makes the whole matter one of the greatest confidentiality. And Ernesto is obliged to continue at the failing arm's length of his patient all through the grand deception, the chaotic coup (even if a fait accompli before it was started) and assassination. Thus we have a parapolitical thriller in which Ambler is only too aware of the pragmatic complexity of a submerged part of the world where the returns are great for a few - but then no \"government can do things for people without doing things to them.\" Ambler's entertainment - and surely it is more than that - is urbane, amusing, cautionary and threateningly urgent at all times - in a word, masterful.

The catalyst is the arrest of a British agent, James Curwen (aka Jeez Carew), in Johannesburg. After Jeez is sentenced to hang, along with four young blacks, he is effectively abandoned by the politically wary English government. Service with the secret intelligence agency had taken Jeez from his wife and baby son, Jack, 24 years earlier. Now Jack learns belatedly of his father's fate and flies from London determined to rescue the doomed man. In Pretoria, Jack meets a white anti-apartheid teenager and his sister, who provide the explosives that Jack sets off at the prisonthe climax to this unremittingly sustained drama.

Though not a predominant character for most of the tale, Christie's legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. Hugh Fraser relates this tale with classic English charm, speaking with a pitch-perfect and ear-pleasing dialect that adds to the atmosphere. Fraser reads with sheer delight, offering a fun variety of characters, including a marvelous take on Poirot himself.

{"asin": "0006276199", "description": "Best-selling author Adrian Plass tells the humorous and poignant tale of a small alien who comes to live in a parish church.

He stated that it was contemporaneous with Christ, an eye-witness account rather than a second-century retrospective.

Graham Stanton was the first top scholar to call the new thesis into question, claiming that the original dating of the fragments was correct.

{"asin": "0006278558", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Reviews of the first edition 'This book has rapidly become a classic of children's spirituality. It provides an empirical and a conceptual basis for the idea of relational spirituality, an understanding that is not only of great practical interest to teachers, clergy and parents, but creates the groundwork for a prophetic protest against forces in the modern world that would undermine the natural spirituality of human beings. It is not only refreshingly clear in an area often somewhat confused, but offers original insights into the lives and attitudes of young children.' - John M Hull is Professor of Practical Theology in the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education in Birmingham and Emeritus Professor of Religious Education at the University of Birmingham, England. 'The Spirit of the Child...is currently the seminal book on children's spirituality on the international scene.' - Christian Education Journal 'Very, very impressive.' - Professor Andrew Greeley, University of Chicago [One of best known sociologists of religion in the world, with a US nationally syndicated newspaper column on religion.] 'For many people, this was a ground-breaking research study...many, perhaps most, subsequent research studies made use of their definitions of spirituality and the broad perspective of spirituality that encompasses all children everywhere.' - Professor Don Ratcliff, Toccoa Falls College 'David Hay and Rebecca Nye have done outstanding research in this difficult, yet most important area. Almost all children are born with a spiritual potential, but how are we to recognize its specificity in a given case and how to foster its development - rather than to let it wither away or even corrupt it unwittingly? Reading this volume will help all involved to understand these issues more deeply, and to contribute more to the blossoming of a child's spirituality.' - Professor K. Helmut Reich, School of Consciousness Studies and Sacred Values, Rutherford University 'It is difficult not to be beguiled by Hay's analysis. What might be called its seamless holisticity, its concern to wed the spiritual to practical and altruistic purpose, and its lack of religious dogmatism (despite Hay's professed Roman Catholic affiliation) provide a sophisticated argument for educational and social purposiveness.' - Clive Erricker, Editor, International Journal of Children's Spirituality 'I have just re-read The Spirit of the Child after seven years. It was recently used in a course I taught at General Theological Seminary in New York City. The book is still as fresh and exciting today as it was seven years ago. You cannot ask for a better team of writers to produce such a volume. I have admired David Hay's work since his days at the Alister Hardy Research Centre at Manchester College, Oxford and his wonderful book, Exploring Inner Space. Dr. Hay is a biologist and experienced researcher in this field as well as an insightful commentator who sets the stage for the research described in The Spirit of the Child. He also contributes to the research, and then follows up with some practices that might be used to help children develop spiritually. Dr. Nye, a child psychologist attached to The Divinity School at Cambridge University, is a gifted and insightful researcher with an informed ability and deep intuition for knowing and being with children. As with Piaget, Winnicott and a handful of others the children knew they could talk to Dr. Nye and that they would be understood a --John M Hull is Professor of Practical Theology in the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education in Birmingham'Today I find references to The Spirit of the Child in many different fields, including education theory, human development, psychology and sociology.

{"asin": "0006281052", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This book by the author of Why Am I Afraid to Love? contains insights on self-awareness, personal growth and communication with others.  Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like.  In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow.

The story begins with one of the churches in Fred's parish being desecrated-- the cross smashed to pieces--and another burned to the ground. The local police force work with Fred to solve the mystery of this vandal who bears a grudge against Christianity. In the wake of the crime, there is uproar at the Archdeacon's reactionary measures, but Fred finds himself in the gleeful position of being able to side with his clergy against the old tyrant.  A Palm Sunday outing for the children of the Bryfelin Estate turns to a drunken afternoon for their irresponsible parents; but Fred's spirits are lifted as he takes the wedding service of his curate, Hugh -- a wet, but thoroughly happy occasion.  These are just a few of the delightful tales that Secombe relates, which will doubtless keep his readers happily amused.", "title": "Two Vandals and a Wedding", "price": 53.63, "salesRank": {"Books": 3921593}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PCN18PKBL.gif", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007122802"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0006281354"]}}

David is an unlikely candidate for priesthood, with a lingering aversion to churches and a propensity to become entangled in the doings of his little flock. Weddings, births, and the rhythm of life in a small community home to interesting characters provide the often poignant and sometimes comical vignettes in the book. There's plenty of  humor--as when bats upset the Holy Week services or David celebrates communion in the TV room of the Eastwith old people's home--juxtaposed with tender scenes of David christening the gypsy babies or keeping vigil with June Goodmanham after a premature delivery. When the vicar becomes increasingly fascinated with the schoolteacher, Rebecca Weighton, the result is predictable, but welcome.

With the failure to stop the 1988 FTA (the precursor to NAFTA), anti-Americanism seems dead, but for the two preceding centuries it had a boisterous run and affected many elections. Usually, the Tories played the anti^-Uncle Sam card, and Granatstein renders their campaigns of 1891 and 1911 in strong hues, as the Conservatives depicted \"reciprocity\" (low tariffs negotiated by the Liberals) as a sellout of Canadian independence. Fifty years later, the Tories were still at it, as Prime Minister Diefenbaker loudly beat the Yankees-out drum, yet lost the 1963 election. However, political antipathy to the southern colossus continued through the '60s and '70s, as Granatstein underscores its manifestations in disparate intellectual and economic areas. This lively presentation, ending with the waning of protectionism in the '80s, surely fills a subject gap in many American libraries.Gilbert Taylor--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JK8JT81AL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0820331139"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 2193415}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

{"asin": "0006379737", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Within the vast body of WW II literature, only a few volumes examine the five-year German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands. The seemingly peaceful takeover has long been viewed as a historical curio; it was the only incidence in which British territory fell under Nazi rule. Bunting, a reporter for Britain's Guardian newspaper, takes a sociologist's view of the episode, examining the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands as an indicator of how a small, closed community coped with the trauma of a forced takeover. Relying on previously untapped archives in the Channel Islands and Moscow, plus other sources, she has produced a captivating study of life during the \"model occupation.\" On the surface, the islanders' behavior toward the Nazis was shocking. Unlike most citizens in other occupied lands, residents of the Channel Islands acquiesced to German rule, to the point of helping to round up local Jews. But Bunting shows that there were strong pockets of defiance and allows the islanders to make the case that in their isolated location, they cooperated for the sake of survival. The author, who took as her research motto, \"There but for the grace of God go I,\" clearly has taken pains to present truth. She has produced a model study.

British author Keay tells an ambitious story with sweep and brio, encompassing the company's origins as a \"bane of bedraggled pioneers\" in search of spices in the remote Indonesian archipelago; its role in the 1690 founding of Calcutta (an episode of \"commercial greed and political mayhem\"); and the opening up of China in 1700, which was to become the company's most profitable trade. Keay not only portays some of the adventurers and potentates who encountered one another but also grasps the details of trade, some more momentous than others: one missive from London to India mixed declarations of war with Spain and complaints about a bar bill. The company's monopoly charter was eventually broken not by rival traders but by British manufacturers wanting more overseas outlets for their products. If, as Keay notes, there are \"enough incomplete histories of the Company to justify a health warning,\" then this book is a salubrious contribution.

{"asin": "0006385141", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "An admiring, rather placid biography of the Canadian filmmaker and wilderness proponent Bill Mason. Mason is best known for his films: Paddle to the Sea, adapted from a children's book about a little carved Indian canoeing and adventuring from Lake Superior to the Atlantic, and Cry of the Wild, his short feature in praise of wolves. He was also the author of several bestselling books on canoeing techniques and history (Path of the Paddle and Song of the Paddle). He brought to all of his various labors both knowledge and love of the great outdoors, as well as doses of Christian sermonizing. It didn't hurt that just as Mason was refining his artistry, during the 1960s and '70s, a great wave of environmental appreciation and concern broke across North America and Europe, giving his material additional currency and power. Raffan's (Outdoor and Experiential Education/Queens Univ., Ontario) biography is a linear model, starting at the beginning--Mason's early days in Winnipeg, his schooling, with much consideration given to his short stature--on through his start in commercial art and photography, his marriage and family life, his breakthrough into directing films, his abandonment of filmmaking and retreat into painting (no critical success there, nor much self-satisfaction), to his death at 59, in 1988, of cancer. There are plenty of excerpts from his journals and letters, but a clear picture of the man never emerges. Perhaps this has to do with Mason's religious bent, with which Raffan seems uncomfortable; you can almost feel him cringe when Mason talks of nature as ``God's creation'' and refers to the outdoors as ``this blessed wilderness.'' Raffan is much happier with Mason the environmental advocate, the canoeist, the guy who should have been a voyageur but was born 200 years too late. Lots of facts, background, and stories, but Mason never gets the breath of life from Raffan. --Copyright &copy;1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Only in Botswana does democracy work; elsewhere, the \"Big Man Disease\" prevails, notes the author. Focusing on individuals but combining travel, history, politics, economics and generalities of African society, Washington Post correspondent Harden explores the indigenous systems that help hold \"the whole sorry mess\" together. He shows how Liberian Samuel Doe's talk about democracy attracted American aid dollars, which he used to shore up the vacillating support of his countrymen. Harden's experiences on a Congo river boat suggest that Zaire is pervaded by the attitude of its president, who has \"made his billions the old-fashioned way. He stole it.\" The account of a trial in Nairobi to determine where to bury a Luo lawyer is an allegory for the most wrenching conflict of modern African life: the rub between tribal tradition and modern Western values.

Angus lies unconscious, possibly in permanent stasis. Ciro plots to destroy the ship, driven insane by the knowledge that alien mutagens have been shot into him by Nick Succorso's sworn enemy, Sorus Chatelaine.

Miller, its antihero, is a smart-ass, hard-drinking bicycle-riding young journalist who gets banished from a busy Belfast daily (for being \"over the top way out pissed as fuck stocious\" drunk in the office) to a boring weekly in Crossmaheart, a rural terrorist hot spot. He's not immediately welcomed at the Chronicle, where his new colleagues bitterly inform him that it's \"normal practice to wait until a body shows up before giving a man's job away.\" Jamie Milburn, Miller's predecessor at the Chronicle, has disappeared. Pursuing the mystery, Miller rides his bike, which he calls the \"Cycle of Violence,\" falls in love with Jamie's gal, Marie, and investigates?and possibly precipitates?a real cycle of violence that hurtles to a fascinating, devastating finale. Bateman's forte is that, without directly addressing Northern Ireland's military/ paramilitary confrontation, the book is drenched and reeking with the pervasive violence and fear of a war-torn state. As the tale unfolds, lives splinter and explode as savagely as the bombs that rock Main Street. This horror is cleverly framed with the blinding sparkle of dark Northern Irish wit?humor so black that it will have readers chuckling even while it reveals the dreadful realities that laughter pretends to camouflage. We probably learn more about life in Northern Ireland from this brilliant, often hilarious novel than from a year of Sunday magazine specials.

{"asin": "0006476058", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A Good Clean Fightfocuses on the British campaign against Rommel in 1942, in particular on one light-armored company's deep reconnaissance of and raids on isolated German airfields--led by the rather daft Jack Lampard--and on Major Paul Schramm, a German intelligence officer, who cleverly tracks the company. We are also introduced to some air squadrons from both sides and their marvelous dogfights. In one tactile scene, a pilot rolls his craft and banks sharply to avoid flak; he \"browns out\" and then finds himself far over the desert, momentarily quite lost. Nonetheless, Schramm and Lampard steal the show, chasing each other, cracking jokes--they are really quite alike, and, seen through their eyes, war is a grim but also a joyous affair. Even the plague of flies that follows these sweating men every step of the way can seem amusing: \"If they followed Lampard rather more faithfully it was not because he was the officer but because he was six foot two and there was more of him to overheat.\" Robinson is extremely funny, actually, and subtle, which lifts his writing out of the genre; even so, he's not much interested in causes or in the meaninglessness of war. Of course it's meaningless, he might say. He wants to focus on young men in a great adventure, risking their lives and loving it, playing deadly games with complicated, deadly machinery. \"Men are always killing themselves to prove their manhood,\" says a woman at Paul Schramm's funeral.

{"asin": "0006481434", "description": "Maillard accurately describes his adult fairy tale as \"a novel about a girl who should have been a boy and a boy who should have been a girl.\" Two Strand River transcends the boundaries between the sexes, between humanity and nature, and between imagination and reality. Although they navigate a physical world that seems soap-opera small, Maillard's characters orbit a rich spiritual terrain. Alan Lehman is a beautician who feels trapped in a male body. His transformation into Ellen, a graceful and confident woman, is aided by Mildred Mackenzie, the mystical mother of one of his customers. \"You're split along a certain seam,\" she explains to him, \"And we have to break you there so you can open.\" Leslie Fraser is a washed-up competitive swimmer turned children's librarian who also finds herself pulled between identities. Central to Two Strand River is this theme of wrenching open, of doing away with conventions, in order to reach a deeper understanding. From Alan's niece to Leslie's oldest brother, each character finds a different type of satisfaction by moving past the familiar into the unknown. This makes for interesting characters but also for a rather wan plot and little narrative drive. For those interested in a book about transcendent spirituality, about characters finding themselves, this book, originally published in Canada, in 1976, has much to recommend it. For those searching for literature, it comes up short.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Two Strand River", "price": 9.95, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KDyQC-KbL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 8828306}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

{"asin": "0006475043", "description": "A novel that mentions, albeit fleetingly, a \"wonderful new musical\" entitled Gimme Back My Pork Chop can't be all bad; indeed, this witty sequel to Boys Like Us is just about all good. In three segments covering the period from November 1989 to May 1990, McGehee continues his exuberant chronicle of Zero McNoo, a shimmering beacon of Toronto's gay set. Zero meets Jeff at an AIDS-research benefit: it seems serious. We meet Zero's oddball family, assembled for an Arkansas wedding: it looks hilarious. (Readers overcome with laughter may wonder what Dear Abby counsels about shoot-'em-ups at nuptial receptions.) The book charms by not trying to; relying on keenly rendered dialogue, McGehee shunts his vivid characters effortlessly between high comedy and drama. (AIDS and \"the camaraderie of the front lines\" are never distant, and are handled with a sensitive, never melodramatic touch.) Though not quite as loopy as it apparently intends to be, the book's almost palpable sweetness creates a winning pastiche. The author's obvious affection for and thorough understanding of his eccentric cast infuses the tale with a cuddly, comic romanticism. Sadly, readers will be deprived of this lovable hero's further adventures: McGehee died of AIDS last September.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Sweetheart", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RBLQWMh0L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312069138"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 13772556}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

Harried L.A. lawyer Mickey Murphy is plagued by a slew of eccentrics who fully bear out the book's epigraph: \"If America is a lunatic asylum then California is the Violent Ward.\" Among them are an ex-wife who tries to get more alimony by perching on the ledge outside his office, a slightly over-the-hill actor in search of a handgun, a Robert Maxwell clone called Sir Jeremy Westbridge and a Trump-like entrepreneur named Zach Petrovich, who owns Murphy's law firm and is married to his high school sweetheart. Their maneuverings spark a complicated plot whose many ramifications include a charitable organization that doubles as a clearinghouse for those seeking to fake their own deaths and the set-up of a tax-free Peruvian corporation through the use of bearer shares, but Murphy keeps all the craziness in perspective with a first-person narration that unfolds as a series of quiet, subtle surprises. Told in perfect Dashiell Hammett style, with the clues all noted but never underlined, this novel respects the reader's intelligence and almost begs for a rereading just to savor how skillfully Deighton has woven everything together.

{"asin": "0006476155", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This second big winter thriller by a writer named Patterson (see Fiction Forecasts, Oct. 19) features a villain (a multiple-personality serial killer/kidnapper) whom the publisher hopes will remind readers of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, and a hero who is compared to those of Jonathan Kellerman. Unfortunately, the novel has few merits of its own to set against those authors' works. Hero Alex Cross is in fact a black senior detective in Washington, D.C., who is also a psychiatrist and has a facile but not entirely convincing line of sentimental-cynical patter. The villain is Gary Soneji/Murphy (read Hyde/Jekyll), who kills for recognition, and finally kidnaps the kids of prominent parents. Alex is soon on the case, more enraged by Gary's killing of poor ghetto blacks than by the Lindbergh-inspired kidnapping, and becomes involved with a gorgeous, motorcycle-riding Secret Service supervisor who is not what she seems. Soneji/Murphy is eventually captured--but can the bad part of him be proven guilty? There is even a hint at the end that he may survive for a sequel, though the reader has virtually forgotten him by then. Spider reads fluently enough, but its action and characters seem to have come out of some movie-inspired never-never land. If a contemporary would-be nail-biter is to thrill as it should, it urgently needs stronger connections to reality than this book has.

He is Hollywood's answer to Ahab, so he deserves a great big book.Nor will fans be disappointed to hear Winslet break character--she plays an upper-class lass from the stuffiest circles--and explain how she helped her costar prepare for their first scene together, in which she stripped for her dishy portrait. &quot;I was naked in front of Leo on the first day of shooting,&quot; says Winslet in the book. &quot;She had no shame with it,&quot; says DiCaprio, who apparently despises shame. &quot;She wanted to break the ice a little beforehand, so she flashed me.

It's an interesting mishmash of a novel--not entirely successful, but enjoyable all the same. Herbert's penchant for gorgeously visceral carnage unfortunately clashes with his equally skilled ability to create a subtle mood of supernatural terror. And he throws way too many ingredients into the stew: family secrets, rape, infanticide, necrophilia, the &quot;Black Arts,&quot; a moldering mansion, a sinister yellow fog, drowning children, poltergeist pranks, a haunted painting, a tormented vicar, a neglectful doctor, even an evil knight.

{"asin": "0006481353", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The son of a black man and a white woman, the down-and-out narrator of Hill's substantial, historically inflected novel, struggles to determine his identity in racially polarized Canada and within his own well-educated, upwardly mobile family. At 39, Langston Cane V is divorced, childless, uprooted, and a failed writer. Prompted by an elderly mentor to write about his forebear's illustrious past, Langston decides to investigate the family lore that claims the first Langston Cane died fighting alongside John Brown at Harpers Ferry in 1859. His research takes him to Baltimore, where half the family lives?among them his tough-talking, corpulent Aunt Milly, who's kept her distance from Langston's side of the Cane clan since Langston's parents' marriage. As he pieces together the puzzle of the past through Milly's stories, diary entries, newspaper clippings, letters and ephemera, Langston's own life appears in sharper focus. His Virgil in urban education is Yoyo, an entrepreneuring Cameroonian illegal immigrant. Langston survives a drive-by shooting, experiences a sexual rejuvenation with a young woman from Milly's church and discovers an old scandal involving his aunt. Hill's (Some Great Thing) generous spirit expands over a wide and variegated landscape of human relations; he forgives oppression and reconciles himself to history with surprising equanimity. His straightforward, good-humored prose, however, seems too deferent to the richness of the story being told. A touch of lyricism would limber up this lengthy work.

Zindell creates a universe loaded with spectacle: computers so immense that their components form orbital rings around suns, artificial intelligence that has evolved to godhood and technology that can shatter stars into novas. But Zindell's narrative conflicts are merely retread versions of plot devices that click with near-cliche familiarity.

{"asin": "0006497802", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Erskine's first novel gets off to a fine start. As a participant in a college research project on hypnotic regression, Jo Clifford is almost too good a subject. Under hypnosis, she relives the final, tortured moments in the life of Matilda, a 12th century Welshwoman. In the process, Jo herself comes close to death. The story then jumps 15 years. Jo, now a journalist researching regression, is again hypnotized and again regresses to Matilda's excitement-packed life. Unfortunately, the pace of the early pages is not maintained. The problem is not with Jo/Matilda, who are both well-drawn, or even with the whopping coincidences Jo encounters. What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. This is still a good read, but it could have been better.

The redoubtable Ida \"Jack\" Troutbeck, Mistress of St. Mary's College, Cambridge (seen in Matricide at St. Martha's), about to be elevated to the House of Lords, imperiously enlists the bookish Amiss to assist her in her latest campaign, namely to defend the ancient British tradition of fox-hunting from an all-out assault by various animal-rights activists. Amiss doesn't quite approve of hunting, but that doesn't deter Troutbeck: \"Bugger your moral susceptibilities,\" she orders, and he does. While the opposition counts among its supporters the likes of Brother Francis (Lord Purseglove), whose vapid nature poetry would embarrass a bunny rabbit, Troutbeck's allies include a couple of boorish lords who must be controlled, while the Rights of Animals League proves a formidable foe. Troutbeck is great fun?a woman of large and lusty appetites who demolishes arguments or a glass of whisky with equal gusto. Amiss is swept along in her wake as the war of words and wits turns to a murderous assault in the House of Lords that leaves several members dead and others shaken.

Still mourning the death of her lover, Richard, Kate is hired by two \"barely comprehensible Glaswegian musicians\" to find out who is trashing their band's reputation by sending goons to break up their shows. She hasn't time to troll Manchester's music scene before friends complicate things by dropping bombshells. First, her business partner announces he's selling his share of the shop and moving to Australia; unfortunately, Kate lacks the funds to buy him out. Then her best friend, Alexis, says that she and her pregnant lover, Christine, need help. The gynecologist who, as Alexis puts it, \"worked with us\" on the pregnancy has been murdered, and Alexis believes that if Kate doesn't steal the relevant medical files they'll lose the baby. And that's if Kate can figure out who the doctor is: Alexis knows her as Helen Maitland, but the newspapers call her Sarah Blackstone. By the time Kate figures out who stabbed the mysterious doctor, she has forgotten why she's looking. But as Kate cruises along, whether setting up a trap with her chum DCI Della Prentice or cutting a deal with the \"Godfather of Manchester\" (who has a fake Italian accent), readers will happily keep up, even if it leaves them a little breathless.

An  introductory essay, written by Ali and Hauser, discusses these powerful  issues and promotes empathy and awareness. Subsequent pages of the  journal contain one or more illuminating quotations by a philosopher, a  public figure or from a religious text, with space available on  alternate pages for the reader to record his or her own thoughts.Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understandingcan help  each of us make a difference and Muhammad Ali is the ideal person to  teach us how. Ali and Hauser&#39;s message is simple: \"If today&#39;s  world is to be truly to be healed, that healing must be achieved one  person at a time. The tolerance and understanding necessary to heal  must come from each and every one of us, arising out of our everyday  conduct, until decency reaches a flood tide.\"Thomas Hauser is the  author of nineteen books, both fiction and nonfiction, includingMuhammad Ali: His Life and Times, which was hailed by theNew  York Timesas \"The definitive Ali biography, incomparable and  indispensable.\" The book was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and the  National Book Award, and was awarded the prestigious William Hill book  of the year prize in England.

It is also a fantasy adventure with sea serpents, pirates, and  all sorts of magic. Theliveshipshave distinct personalities and partner with specific people, somewhat likeAnne McCaffrey'sBrain ships and their Brawns, though these are trading ships and have full  crews.Hobb has peopled the book with many wonderfully developed characters.  Most of the primary ones are members of the Vestritts, an Old Trader family which owns the liveshipVivacia.  Their stories are intercut with those of Kennit, the ambitious pirate Brashen, the disinherited scion of another family who served on the Vestritt's ship, andParagon, an old liveship  abandoned and believed mad.   The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.ThoughShip of Magicis full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book. Readers who resent being left with many questions and few answers after almost 700 pages should think twice before starting, or wait until the rest of the series is out so that their suspense won't be too prolonged. But Hobb's writing draws you in and makes you care desperately about what will happen next, the mark of a terrific storyteller.--Nona Vero--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Ship of Magic (The Liveship Traders)", "price": 7.33, "salesRank": {"Books": 1748033}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6161dsnKaaL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0553103334", "0553103237", "0553575643", "0007459742", "0553575651", "055357339X", "0553565699", "0553573411", "B0073G6H10", "0062116851", "0553801481", "0007562268", "0553374451", "000648011X", "0553582453", "0061561630", "0553582445", "0553801511", "0553801546", "0061931411", "0061561622", "B001KS1HRG", "0006486029", "0553106406"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0553582445", "0553582453", "0553582461", "055357339X"]}}

After Grace dies, Neville marries socialite Dido Tallent, but when their first child dies at birth, his faith in both God and his own motives is rocked. In crisis, Neville asks his colleague Jon Darrow (narrator of Glamorous Powers ) for spiritual first aid and, guided by a wise abbot friend of Jon's, is forced to an honest appraisal of himself and his ambition--which has its roots in his early life. He struggles back to spiritual health and eventually emerges a wiser man, more honest and loving toward his family and his flock. This is the third in Howatch's incomparable series about the Church of England in the 20th century; it's a measure of her achievement that, besides telling a fascinating story boldly and well, she illuminates often quite abstruse religious and ecclesiastical questions. Here, Neville's ministry to captured Germans in a local prisoner-of-war camp leads to the discussion of Christian--ethical, moral--behavior during war, a topic that can never be out of date.

She begins to pull herself together when a journalist tells her that the crash was no accident, that it was a terrorist bombing covered up by the world's intelligence agencies. Then the journalist is murdered, and Stephanie is recruited into a shadowy law enforcement agency to become a killer. If the plot of this first novel sounds a little like the movie and TV seriesLa Femme Nikita, that's understandable. But Burnell manages to inject some new life into the tired premise. Stephanie is a tough, resilient heroine, seriously challenged by the multiple personalities she's forced to don, while focused laserlike on avenging her family's death. Even the terrorists emerge as more than cardboard cutouts, especially in the climactic scene in which Stephanie confronts her antagonist.

Archates, incompetent Dynast, is fearful and easily manipulated, willing to sacrifice his kingdom, his people, and even his own daughters to preserve himself. The barbarian Tathars are on the march, taking advantage of the Dynast's cowardice and slowly crushing the Ascendancy. Evil Erkai the Chain aids the Tathars with his forbidden Black Craft--the magic of death. In the middle of this desperate situation, the luminessa Mandine, uncertain heir to the Ascendancy throne, experiences a vision in which the God and Goddess instruct her to find the Signata, enigmatic tool of Deep Magic. If she succeeds, Erkai and the Tathars can be defeated. If not, the universe will be threatened by unspeakable evil. To make matters worse, Mandine's stepsister Theatana has designs on the throne and is willing to torture, kill, and dabble in the Black Craft to get it.But never fear, our plucky heroine doesn't have to go it alone.

{"asin": "0006512666", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The dazzling pyrotechnics of British author Smith's last two future noir spectacles, Spares (under option to DreamWorks) and One of Us (under option to Warner Brothers), are prefigured in his promise-filled debut novel, a 1994 U.K. paperback original now seeing its first hardcover publication. Set in a stylized future City where individuals live in neighborhoods organically responsive to their moods and lifestyles, the story begins as a routine missing persons case for its narrator, Stark, an irreverent soft-boiled detective type who specializes in \"finding people, or things.\" Stark's retrieval of Fell Alkland, a scientist who has fled the driven environment of Action Center for the placid Stable neighborhood, proves relatively easy. But pursuit by Action Center operatives and Alkland's crippling work-related nightmares force Stark and his quarry to escape to Jeamland, a collective repository of dreams and childhood memories that Stark appears to know very well, and to which, as he discovers only belatedly, he has been lured back deliberately. The genius of Smith's narrative is its casual revelation that the detective scenario and detailed elaborations of the City that pull the reader into the story are clue-filled set-ups for the real story of Stark's self-discovery in Jeamland. Ultimately, this requires chapters of explanatory exposition that slow down the finale and betray the awkwardness of a new writer growing into his skills. Nevertheless, the story blazes with a visionary intensity that fires its imagery and fuels its premise that \"once you've gone forward, you can't go home again.\" (Dec.)Philip K.

Her debut novel is an unpretentious gem of a book that charts the late coming-of-age of Miss Julia Garnet, a retired English schoolteacher who spends six months in Venice after her lifelong companion, Harriet, dies. Venice has a magical effect on reserved Julia: a dyed-in-the-wool Communist, she relaxes in her antipathy toward religion, and even begins to visit the local church. There, she becomes enamored of a series of paintings that tell the story of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, a tale that mixes elements of Judaism with the religion of Zoroaster. In the story, young Tobias travels to Medea, part of the Persian Empire, to collect a debt for his father, blind Tobit. He is accompanied on his journey by a hired guide who turns out to be the Angel Raphael. As Julia learns more about Tobias's trek, she embarks upon a soul-altering journey of her own. She falls in love with an art dealer, Carlo, and befriends Sarah and Toby, twins working on the restoration of a Venetian chapel. When Toby disappears suddenly, after discovering a priceless Renaissance painting, Julia finds out that neither Carlo nor the twins are exactly what they seem--but that the Angel Raphael's watchful spirit will help good prevail. (Feb.)Forecast: This touching novel, a sleeper hit in Britain, should win American fans eager for a treatment of religious themes without the gooey sentiment that often accompanies the topic of angels.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Miss Garnet's Angel", "price": 12.61, "salesRank": {"Books": 1004728}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NkkYdXfIL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0670785679", "0312423802", "0142180971", "0156983567", "0312569327", "0312426798", "1931257493", "B006CDMGMO", "0312269552", "0553581414", "0758263228"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0142180564", "0142180971", "0312423802", "B006CDMGMO"]}}

{"asin": "0006514006", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Sisterly rivalry is the basis of this fresh, wonderfully vivid retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn. Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king's court at a young age, as players in their uncle's plans to advance the family's fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII's favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (\"kin and enemies all at once\") feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.", "title": "The Other Boleyn Girl", "price": 8.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2223030}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BLEBMtJ6L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0743272498", "1439124671", "0743269268", "0743246071", "1416549145", "074327251X", "1451626088", "1416563717", "1476735484", "1476746303", "1416590889", "145162610X", "1451626096", "B0012QE4Q2", "1451629559", "0802136834", "1451626118", "0743272501", "1402224680", "0743249313", "0743249305", "1451626126", "0743249291", "145162607X", "0743272528", "074327248X", "0743272544", "1416563687", "0743256158", "0743269829", "1416549129", "0345407865", "145165684X", "1402214316", "0778314316", "0345453220", "1416563725", "1451629540", "1416563709", "B0064X92RY", "0743272536", "B00EBFE5RY", "1482702371", "0312194390", "B001L57ZZG", "0345495365", "0345391780", "0312429983", "1416593144", "0345495349", "0312374615", "1451648626", "0446550124", "0385489498", "1402265581", "145162686X", "0743296443", "0425230082", "B0058M7Z1C", "0451237897", "B00114XM04", "0679781587", "B000RF7XYY", "1491280093", "0544222881", "1405134631", "0385338139", "0143124927", "B0031MA7SO", "0312370849", "0345453247", "B00E1LT41K", "1402237669", "1451633246", "0743454537", "B004E3XDGC", "014242417X", "0440212561", "1416547819", "1565125606", "0316228583", "0375842209", "B007PM0W3Q", "125002417X", "0451223136", "1439153663", "B000Z8H0IC", "0375847227", "0312378025", "1451617488", "B000ZOXDFA", "0312382456", "0345404335", "0062280678", "0440215625", "1451681755", "1451635621", "B001FE1DKG", "014241493X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0743272498", "B0012QE4Q2", "1439124671", "1416563717"]}}

{"asin": "0006514642", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The author of the Wideacre trilogy offers another intense, absorbing tale, a grisly drama of passion and witchcraft in 16th-century England. Growing up as an ill-used apprentice to Morach, the much-feared wise woman of the moors, Alys finds respite by joining an order of Catholic nuns. When young Lord Hugo and his men burn the abbey to the ground during a drunken rampage, Alys is the only one to escape; she flees back to Morach, consumed with guilt at having abandoned her dying sisters. Summoned to minister to Lord Hugh, Hugo's father, Alys soon finds herself deeply involved in the treachery and intrigue surrounding the old man's attempts to have his son's marriage to the barren Lady Catherine annulled. Attracted to Hugo despite his murderous past, Alys begins to practice witchcraft in earnest to rid him of Catherine and become his wife. Her spells work all too well: Catherine's long-awaited pregnancy ends disastrously, and Hugo comes to love Alys, but in a sickly haze of lust that provides no basis for marriage. Alys soon finds herself so sunk in evil, so removed from God's love, that only a truly shocking gesture can bring about her salvation. Gregory adeptly manipulates hair-raising horror and mounting suspense, brilliantly evoking the period's turbulent atmosphere.

In addition to an informative narrative of the U.N.'s frustrating attempts to limit Saddam's weapons program, Trevan offers a valuable perspective on U.N. bureaucracy at a time when the organization is trying to assert its power and influence around the world. He describes the personal dynamics that replace national loyalties; the emphasis on negotiating finesse and the careful parsing of written agreements; the heavy dependence on leaks, back-channeling and spin. From the beginning, Iraqi officials placed every possible obstacle in UNSCOM's path. The deception and evasions were, in Trevan's view, as brazen as they were comprehensive. In the resulting game of \"catch us if you can,\" UNSCOMAwith significant help from Israeli intelligenceAscored its share of limited, specific successes. In Trevan's final analysis, however, the triumphs were ephemeral as Saddam Hussein continued his weapons research programs, inconvenienced but unthwarted. Not surprisingly, Trevan concludes that \"Iraq was not interested in cooperating with UNSCOM.\" To the book's fundamental questionAhow can democracies force a hostile nondemocracy to \"be good\" without compromising democratic principles?ATrevan offers some answers in an epilogue. He argues for an increasing transfer of both sovereignty and power to international organizations, specifically the U.N. In fact, despite Saddam's success in dodging UNSCOM, Trevan considers UNSCOM a paradigm: \"excellent people bound by a strong culture of achievement and attention to detail.\"Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Saddam's Secrets: The Hunt for Iraq's Hidden Weapons", "price": 15.37, "salesRank": {"Books": 2787863}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414WRMGF2JL.jpg", "related": {"buy_after_viewing": ["1591454042"]}}

{"asin": "0006531563", "description": "A scholar who was awarded the Wolfson Prize for History for 1990's The Architecture of Medieval Britain: A Social History, Platt focuses on the economic, political, religious and cultural factors that enabled the creation of art, tending to gloss over the art itself. The book proves repeatedly that, in the words of Philip Hamerton, \"the man who has money will rule the man who has art\" and examines how the Black Death, the French Revolution and other historical turning points affected art production. Initially, churches' stained glass and altarpieces comprised the entirety of the art world. Eventually, churches were adorned with frescoes, paintings and statuary, and still later, art began to be commissioned for civic beautification and decoration, as a status symbol or a political tool, as an investment and for private enjoyment. Platt assumes the reader is conversant in art history and familiar with myriad politicians and religious figures, and his abrupt references give the book a choppy feel and tend to muddy lines of argument. Casual readers may have trouble with this sweeping history, but specialists and those with an art history background will find Platt's work illuminating and relentlessly informative. 32 pages of color reproductions.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0006511775", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Masquerading as a trashy novelist may solve English writer Isobel Latimer's financial problems, but it also plunges her into a full-fledged identity crisis in Gregory's flighty, overplotted novel. Isobel needs money to support her ailing husband, Philip, and his newfound interest in pool building, so when her agent, Troy Cartwright, informs her that her literary novels are earning less and less, she tells him, \"If they won't pay me to write good books, then I'll just have to write bad.\" She and Troy invent the persona of Zelda Vere, a heavily made-up, well-dressed blonde bombshell, the opposite of 52-year-old country matron Isobel. Zelda's \"survivor fiction,\" The Devil's Disciple, is a major hit that earns Isobel all the money she could ever need, but she finds herself increasingly caught between superego and id, between an unfulfilling loyal marriage and sexual experimentation with Troy. When Isobel sets off on her book tour with Troy, Gregory's plot takes an exotic and erotic turn, depicting a world of cross-dressing, cocaine and champagne. Returning to her home in Kent, Isobel finds Philip miraculously recovered and expending all his energy on the construction of an expensive new pool. Philip has also decided to invest (with Isobel's money) in the handsome pool man's business. Backstabbers reveal themselves, to no one's surprise, and Isobel's deliberationsAshould she stay or should she go?Aare prolonged until an abrupt, bewildering denouement puts a stop to the runaway narrative. Gregory, a popular writer of historical fiction (Earthly Joys, etc.), knows whereof she speaks when she describes television interviews and book deals, though the over-the-top fantasy she spins from the details may test readers' patience.

{"asin": "0006531113", "description": "After ten years, it is easy to forget that Germany was a divided country for more than 40 years. Post-World War II politics determined that Nazi Germany would be divided into two parts: a Western democratic country influenced by the Americans, British, and French and an Eastern Socialist/Communist country influenced by the former Soviet Union. What remains of this artificial divide? German-born and Oxford-educated August, a Times correspondent who has recently received the Anglo-German Foundation Journalism Award, tries to answer this question in an engrossing account of his search for the physical and social remnants of the border that once divided West and East Germany. As August meticulously wends his way down the former frontier, he encounters difficulties in finding the actual border but has no problem reporting on conversations with residents who have lingering doubts about the advantages of unification and the possibility of creating a truly unified Germany. This is a fearless, critical, accurate, and balanced assessment of the complicated political and social situation that will fester despite the elimination of a strong, physical barrier. Highly recommended for all European travel and history collections. Olga B.

Fuzzy logic posits a world in which absolutes, such as those implied in the words \"true\" and \"false , \" are less important and interesting than the matters of degree between them. \"Fuzziness is grayness,\" and \"the truth lies in the middle,\" according to Kosko, one of the pioneers of fuzzy logic theory, which he persuasively presents as a world view rooted more in Buddhist and Taoist assumptions than in the dichotomous Aristotelian tradition. He proposes FATs (Fuzzy Approximation Theorems) for the existence (and non-existence, as fuzziness demands) of God and as models of the abortion debate. In consumer terms, fuzzy logic is behind such \"smart\" machines as air conditioners and microwave ovens that gauge their operation to the conditions and demands of a given moment's task.

Using numerous interviews and anecdotes, Baxter sketches a picture that is never quite flattering, but is empathetic and fascinating. He tells De Niro&#x92;s story through the prism of the actor&#x92;s most notable cinematic endeavors (including Taxi Driver and Raging Bull) as well as through his biggest failures. As a result, the book is equal parts life story and film analysis. This works to great effect, since De Niro&#x92;s artistic choices, many of which involved physical transformations and psychological sparring with his fellow actors, reveal as much, if not more, about his own character as any exposition on the actor&#x92;s life experience. As Baxter portrays him, De Niro appears more comfortable being anyone other than himself. His total immersion into characters such as Travis Bickle spooked his co-stars but won him great acclaim, despite what the author describes as a career decline that began with The King of Comedy. In subsequent years, Baxter notes, De Niro has rested on his reputation, choosing mediocre but commercially viable projects that would, in turn, fund his entrepreneurial pursuits in his beloved lower Manhattan neighborhood. De Niro remains one of cinema&#x92;s most enduring presences, a human puzzle, perhaps even unto himself. 40 b/w photos.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0006514774", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Irish writer Kelly (Someone Like You) knows exactly what women want in their contemporary romances-to escape into a world populated by believable characters in search of more satisfying lives sprinkled with romance. Her latest, rich with the emerald allure of the lush Irish landscape and tart with Kelly's sexy, bracing humor, follows four diverse women linked to the charming Kerry town of Redlion. Hope Parker, 37 (\"Mrs. Tracksuit Bottom\"), is the mother of two, wife of Matt, who is an ad exec/closet novelist and heir of his uncle's Curlew Cottage in Redlion. Hope fears she will lose her handsome husband-(\"The seven year itch wasn't just an itch; it was a damn outbreak of eczema\")-and quickly agrees to accompany him for a year's writing sabbatical during which her marriage is surprisingly challenged by her attraction to another man. Hope's sister, Samantha (Sam) Smith, \"teetering on the abyss of 40,\" is a hip London music mogul, rattled by a doctor's diagnosis and a raging discontent that can be dealt with only when she finally admits what she needs. Virginia Connell, 58, a grieving widow from Dublin, moves to Redlion, takes up golf and finds that there is life after loss. Discontented Irish/Indian Nicole Turner, 23, loves karaoke but dreams of singing professionally. After she's discovered by one of Sam's A & R people, Nicole learns that fame and fortune pale in comparison to her need for independence and love. Surrounding these women are many thoroughly developed supporting characters and sufficient side plots to fuel a sequel. Romance fans should rejoice in this chatty, comfortable story, as warm and satisfying as Irish oatmeal.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "What She Wants", "price": 10.38, "salesRank": {"Books": 7060328}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417ZCGADKWL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1451616767", "0452283388", "1451681402", "B001PO69G4", "B001P5HD54", "B006CDEK6E", "B0058M5CLM", "B001PO69GO", "B003E7EW1O", "0747260583", "0747260575", "1853717967", "0007373678", "0143118498", "0307273571", "0060890681", "0425260933", "0747266352", "1611099285", "0451240596", "125004264X", "0060731486", "0425259692", "1476704511", "0060586133", "0385351852", "0743457463", "1409136612", "0425251896", "0007154054", "0060090383", "0451239687", "1402281293", "1902602692", "0007331444", "1402253168", "1439152810", "0241950589", "0749909307", "1409135411", "B005HKP7XS", "0752883437", "0747243905", "0752884336", "0755343964", "075289336X", "0752865455", "1400097304", "0007466935", "0752847953", "0752883496", "0141028564", "1451609116", "1482385635", "0755378407", "0747257876", "0345462807", "1447208668", "1444706829", "184744458X", "0954491335", "0755343808", "184983203X", "1439107173", "0752883526", "1842231618", "184827081X", "1400097320", "1848270151", "1847562817", "1848270712", "0330520539", "1847562779", "0345462823", "0340932872", "1451606419", "0857380001"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1451681402", "B005Q6ECLG", "0452283388", "B001PO69G4"]}}

This account presents edited portions of journal entries written during trips to remote mountain areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kurdistan between 1952 and 1965, as well as numerous black-and-white photographs that he took at the time. Some of these areas are more developed today than they were half a century ago, while others are even more inaccessible owing to political upheavals. Thesiger's writing is sparse, as would be expected from diary entries, and consequently may disappoint those looking for more detail or seeking current travel information. Those wanting to know more about Thesiger's remarkable life should read his autobiography, The Life of My Choice (LJ 3/15/98), which ought to be an essential purchase even for small public libraries.

{"asin": "0006550452", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Without a sharp focus, authors tackle the history of modern India at their peril. French, whose first book, Younghusband, won the 1995 Somerset Maugham Award, tries to do a bit too much. It's difficult to uncover new ground in the well-spaded turf of Indian independence. French is not the first to see Gandhi as a crank obsessed with bowel functions, Winston Churchill as a racist and the 1947 British exit strategy as a case of muddling through. He does, however, succeed at filling in some gaps, especially about British intelligence operations. French (who ran for Britain's parliament as a Green candidate and is currently director of the Free Tibet Campaign) nagged the Foreign Office to declassify 92 \"bottle-green boxes\" of files, and his analysis reveals a dying Raj under severe financial stress held together by undercover operations. Although his criticisms of Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre's Freedom at Midnight are unlikely to dethrone that classic, he argues persuasively that the authors swallowed an elderly Lord Mountbatten's egocentric recollections and inaccurately made the creation of Pakistan a cliff-hanger dependent on the health of Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Noteworthy also are glimpses of various British viceroys, perspectives on the amalgamation of the princely states into the nation and an update on the increasing adulation in India of Axis ally Subhas Chandra Bose. French's travel notes and wit leaven the narrative somewhat, but many readers will find that this demanding journey covers too much territory too quickly.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Liberty or Death: India's Journey to Independence and Division", "price": 12.03, "salesRank": {"Books": 1130881}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81mLi2H4InL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0142001007", "1400034175", "0224039563", "1400078334", "0307700208", "0520207173", "0307473481", "014200412X", "8172238746", "0195393945", "0006376010"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0300143338", "1400034175", "0006376010", "0393318982"]}}

With excerpts from published works by energetic young writers who remain, for the most part, untranslated, de Chamberet, a literary agent who works both sides of the Channel, is determined to rescue French literature from \"cold cerebrality and self-indulgent navel-gazing.\" Reactionary Michel Houellebecq, whose Elementary Particles has just exploded on American shores, will be recognized in the voice of his odious, cynical narrator, who attempts to incite a friend to murder a young woman he desires because love is \"no longer possible,\" in \"The Port of Call.\" A more modestly subversive tale, Marie Desplechin's \"Haiku,\" explores racism among 20-something professionals at a dinner party. Ilan Duran Cohen, in \"Wonderland,\" one of the few emotionally resonant pieces, recounts a young Jewish man's New York-Paris conversations with his mother, who is obsessed with getting her nose fixed. North African-born writers Abdourahman Waberi and Mounsi offer thoughtful father-son stories.

After taking his daily dose of methadone in the morning -- he became readdicted in New York in 1980 -- he spent the afternoons reading and writing right up until his death in August 1997. \"Last Words\" collects these daily jottings in his notebooks, the entire literary output from the last nine months of his life!With only the love of his cats, literature and methadone left, these journals make for unbearably poignant reading. Unlikely as it may sound, Bill Burroughs was only human after all.' The Times  'With his canes, suits and absurd fedoras, William S. Burroughs was the dandy manque who invented geek chic and made modernism available to the hippie masses!Now that Burroughs' final journals have been published, edited by his companion and literary executor, James Grauerholz, a comprehensive sense of the man and his achievement, for better and for worse, is at last available. Grauerholz's introduction and notes are a fine mixture of fact and feeling, and make \"Last Words\" a synthetic whole!The journals are an exploration in depth, and in sum, of Burroughs' personality and creative pre-occupations![A] rich repetition, with variations, of a string of half-conscious fancies, scenarios and literary allusions. \"Last Words\" also presents fresh clues to the larger design of his imagination, and a means of gaining a renewed perspective on his work.' New York Times  '\"Where is the cavalry, the spaceship, the rescue squad?\" asked William Burroughs on May 26 1997. He didn't realize that it was on its way: three months later, he was dead!\"Last Words\" reveals the author of \"Naked Lunch\" riddled with arthritis and still saddled with guilt for shooting his common-law wife in 1951. Although he seems more vulnerable than ever before, the anti-establishment anger continues to flare up at odd moments, his skewed sense of humour still sends out sparks.' Time Out  'There's a savage glamour about William Burroughs, both in his writing and his life!\"Last Words\", made during the last nine months of his life, shows him to be as sharp-minded as ever.' Ham & High  'The entries in \"Last Words\" were made as Burroughs came to terms with his impending demise, and they are at once elegiac and filled with a curious kind of contentment at the way things have turned out. For the first and only time, he reveals a gentler self, full of years and filled with grace. He was a great American writer to the end.' Gay Times  'A fascinating read.

{"asin": "0006544754", "description": "In this collection of well-written short stories, Irish writer O'Connor ( Cowboys and Indians ) links together a series of tales concerning such domestic crises as abortion, infidelity and separation. The most exciting is \"The Long Way Home,\" a title with a Celtic ring but a plot reminiscent of a Rod Serling scenario, in which a man leaves his wife one night and picks up a very strange hitchiker. Most of the protagonists are Irish men or women considering big changes in their lives. Some look to England for it, as in \"Last of the Mohicans\" and \"Mothers Were All the Same,\" and almost all are detached from the familiar landscape of Irish fiction. (For once, pubs are left out of the picture, although there is considerable drinking.) An exception is \"The Hills Are Alive,\" which examines the strange double life of IRA volunteer Danny Sullivan. O'Connor's style is terse and graphic, attuned to the voices of his young characters. At times, as in the title story, \"True Believers,\" it proves a powerful literary tool; more often it shows off a tiresome alienation that works well when a story's plot is strong enough to justify it, but sags when the story is no more thna a portrait of several sad characters, as in \"The Bedouin Feast.\"Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "True Believers", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WHS990ZBL.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 11220129}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

WhereasLifetook the reader on a whistle-stop tour of evolution from start to present--a huge undertaking that necessarily granted little space to each time period or taxonomic group--Trilobite!sees Fortey indulging in a whole book about his overriding paleontological passion, the long extinct and enigmatic creatures of the title. The result is a joy.Trilobites--woodlicelike creatures that dominated the world's oceans long before the time of the dinosaurs--are, arguably, the most beautiful animals that have ever been chipped out of the fossil record. Fortey certainly seems to think so. His enthusiastic, almost loving explanations of the anatomy, ecology, and long evolutionary history of these fascinating vanished creatures carry the reader on an inspirational journey into the Earth's distant past. But the book is much more than a technical treatise on trilobites. We learn about Fortey himself, his formative years as an amateur then professional paleontologist, about his much-loved teachers and colleagues, and above all, about that strange but addictive pastime known as science. You may not find arthropods as charming as Fortey does, but you will not fail to be charmed by the author.

{"asin": "0006545467", "description": "Another very funny, drily British novel by the author of Ease and The Aerodynamics of Pork. Hilary Metcalfe, an English teacher addicted to American musical comedy recordings, celebrates his 25th birthday alone, his gorgeous bisexual lover Rufus having stood him up. In an inebriated state, Hilary discovers an abandoned infant in the subway and takes the baby home to his seedy West London digs above an Indian grocery. Meanwhile, Rufus, unfortunately detained in a female student's bed, steps out of it and almost at once into the arms of Hilary's sister Henry (for Henrietta), a psychiatrist rarely impressed by masculine charm. As the baby wraps his fingers more and more tightly around Hilary's heart, he comes under the ever-watchful eye of his landlord's adoring adolescent daughter, who has made a shrine of his every discarded envelope and wornout shoelace. Now Sumitra recognizes Hilary's true divinity: he is a father who bears his own child, a Prince God. The bawdy narrative strands are cleverly woven together with witty and urbane dialogue and piquant characterization, so that the reader is thoroughly absorbed in this irreverent tour de force.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Kansas in August", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416X3XNA25L.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0007313454", "B005Q6BSU4", "0006550746", "0007151004", "052524445X", "0006545459", "0007307683", "0525244999", "0007465084", "0002253836"]}, "salesRank": {"Books": 1880432}, "categories": [["Books"]]}

{"asin": "0006551807", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: \"At Brown, her rebellion had been academic ... she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.\" Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity. There's no  cleverness or showing-off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling. Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy; it's simply that ordinary, hard-to-get-down-on-paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Namesake", "price": 8.52, "salesRank": {"Books": 2058809}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DK3%2BMPneL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0452285585", "0952419327", "0307907694", "0307455912", "039592720X", "0307278255", "074347757X", "014023828X", "0062301675", "B000U2U0E4", "0143038095", "0375714839", "0295993537", "0143113283", "0538744383", "1906523134", "0486270572", "1451683561", "0807610666", "0312099436", "0385474547", "0143114557", "159448385X", "0307278263", "1472526414", "1492964964", "1585428868", "157322815X", "0394757076", "0071803793", "0553213806", "067976402X", "1616202416", "4770030002", "1559361190", "1416523731", "0156034026", "0393925293", "0192801635", "1603849386", "0312626681", "0486268705", "0307387895", "0061577073", "0465020291", "1457628937", "159463193X", "0393323080", "0970959737", "076790818X", "0811216020", "1936045060", "0486277860", "0809012235", "0192853961", "0061120065", "0679746048", "0872203166", "0199234981", "067972267X", "140003471X", "0495913081", "0802130410", "0312243022", "0385260458", "0385486804", "0143039431", "1936045095", "0060779004", "0205751555", "0495913073", "1420926659", "044669889X", "068480154X", "0658015060", "0374530696", "0486292827", "0679728228", "074347712X", "0142002100", "0156012952", "1439049408", "0061130249", "1400078776", "0679759611", "0679745130", "0007350805", "0375842209", "0553214063", "0140449108", "074324754X", "1285458419", "0789749033", "0812979656", "1400052181", "0978252691", "0618706410", "074326116X", "226612630X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0307278263", "039592720X", "0307278255", "0062301675"]}}

{"asin": "000655198X", "description": "Broady (Swimmer) literately and artistically probes the dark corners of blue-collar British life in his first short story collection, deftly maneuvering his way through gutbucket settings while displaying his smart, perceptive and often fascinating voice. He's at his best in the longer entries, often taking an appealing conceit and twisting it in a variety of intriguing directions, most notably in \"Bouncing Back,\" a story about the reappearance of some talented and versatile bears in a down-and-out British town. He delves into man's relationship with domestic animals in \"Wrestling Jacob,\" the tale of a lusty architect who sublimates his libido in a series of wrestling matches with a sheep. Broady is also a bit of a literary pub-crawler, choosing saloons for his setting in several stories, the most appealing being \"The Tale of the Golden Bath Taps,\" the story of a musician's very strange relationship with a stripper. Also included is a lovely, glowing tribute to Sun Ra in \"Short Cut to the Sun,\" the description of a night at one of the late musician's wonderfully bizarre concerts. Broady's characters often find themselves taking a winding, choppy road to their destinations, and the author doesn't always connect the dots or fill in the narrative gaps as well as he could. But his sharp, rough-hewn voice sticks out like a wolf in a chicken coop, and this book represents another solid building block in the career of an author who shows signs of becoming a literary star.

In a following chapter, after she spills paint on the floor and herself, she decides to run away. After each disaster, her mother comforts and reassures her. Josie is an endearing character, and Nabb includes many funny recurring images, such as how Josie shuts her eyes every time she tells a lie.

{"asin": "000655069X", "description": "Writer and journalist Taylor, author of two other works with  African themes, Shaka's Children and The Mighty Nimrod, provides  here snippets of enthralling individual tales complemented with  a thoughtful commentary. Recounting his travels from Lake  Victoria to the Cape of Good Hope, Taylor explores what the  future holds for the white citizens of the black continent in  which he was raised. Although skilled at reporting and  storytelling, Taylor is less successful as a social and  political thinker. His subjects, an eclectic mix, are not  missionaries or explorers and may even lack Livingstone's  dignity and vision. That they are white and living in  sub-Saharan Africa is all that makes them members of  \"Livingstone's tribe.\" The reader is therefore tempted to  conclude that this unimpressive association is a mere outcome of  a nostalgic indulgence. Yet Taylor deserves credit for openly  addressing the precarious fate of many whites who still call  post-independence Africa home. This blend of social history and  travelog may be of interest to travel enthusiasts but is more  suitable for social science collections. Edward K. Owusu-Ansah,  Murray State Univ.

Still, encouraged by his fearless friend George, the two centipedes make several trips to these destinations, where they encounter dangerous creatures and barely make it home with their cuticles intact. Later on, when smoke invades their tunnel, the two frantically crawl through the \"Up Pipe\" and discover a gigantic \"meat mountain\" that they soon realize is a sleeping Hoo-Min. They escape just in time to scuttle down the pipe and revive the smoke-struck Belinda. Having learned the difference between bravery and foolhardiness, they live happily ever after. This simplistic fantasy is a stretch for even the most accepting readers. The characters never develop but remain insects who have human characteristics uncomfortably imposed upon them. The author is often didactic, defining potentially unfamiliar words or explaining the anatomy of centipedes. The humor is more silly than funny, and this attempt to present things through the eyes of insects is far-fetched and uninteresting. A disappointingly dull book.?Wendy D.

It is the story of Thowra, a silvery-white brumby, who becomes leader of his own herd over the course of the book, defeating other stallions and evading the men who try to capture him. This fairly realistic horse story occasionally slips into a more fantastical style, such as when the horses converse with each other and with other animals (cows, kangaroos, dingoes) and when Mitchell attributes human emotions and thoughts to Thowra. Lee's voice walks, trots, canters, and gallops through the story, as appropriate to the action. The book is prefaced with an Australian glossary, primarily consisting of descriptions of the local flora and fauna. There are musical cues for the beginning and end of each chapter as well as each side of the tape.

{"asin": "0006646271", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Pencil sketches and naturalistic color art transport readers to the Australian outback in this affecting tale of a wombat who has lost his mother. As he searches for her, he encounters a variety of other creatures, from a kookaburra to a boy. Each asks, \"What can you do, Wombat?\" His neighbors dismiss his answer (\"Not much. I dig a lot and I think a lot\") and show off their own skills. But it's Wombat who saves the day when a forest fire threatensDhe digs a hole large enough to shelter them all. In return, his new friends help him find his mother. Morpurgo (previously paired with Birmingham for The Wreck of the Zanzibar) bolsters his story with pleasing repetitions, and his message about the importance of valuing the contributions of each individual in a community comes through clearly but gently. Birmingham's artwork is no less than sublime. Nimbly sketched animal studies adorn the margins of the pages containing text, and alternate with full-page vistas of the bush and its creatures, their softly smudged outlines gilded with light. Avoiding anthropomorphism, Birmingham nevertheless presents the wombat as an altogether winning creature, small and sturdy and determined. Oversize in format (9\"x121/2\") and suffused with warmth, this picture book opens a window on wildlife Down Under. Ages 4-8.

Under a bright, newly designed dust jacket lies the same old beloved Paddington, the always dignified, well-meaning, but troublemaking bear from \"darkest Peru.\" Young readers will enjoy this reissue of the 1962 classic, which includes some of Paddington's best adventures (or misadventures, depending) in the extensive Paddington canon, such as his wild ride on a power lawnmower and his appearance on a game show, where his unusual logic wins him the jackpot. Paddington is, understandably, a favorite character for kids, one they can truly relate to, as his best-laid, well-intentioned plans somehow go topsy-turvy. As always, Bond's prose is fun to read, with the solemn, serious Paddington providing humorous contrast to the absurd goings-on around him. Peggy Fortnum's spare, evocative, often witty line drawings are as wonderful as ever, more representative of Paddington's character than the new jacket art, which makes him look like a cute, cuddly stuffed toy--a portrait with which Paddington himself would take issue.Shelle Rosenfeld--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Paddington at Large", "price": 6.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2275151}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uur4XoePL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007174160", "0006753450", "0006753434", "061831105X", "0006753442", "0006753663", "0618250727", "0006753795", "0007269412", "0006753787", "B004HI79LY", "0061170747", "0062312189", "0060282134", "0060296968", "0061687405", "0007458851", "0007104405", "0395066395", "0689715625", "0618083073", "0142411647", "0061473642", "0618331417", "0395143314", "0006647448", "0395066409", "0395066425"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061170747", "0062312189", "0006753434", "0060296968"]}}

{"asin": "0006923992", "description": "Great granddaughter to Charles Dickens, Monica (1915-1992) was born into an upper middle class family. Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out - she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain. No More Meadows, which she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC  - she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children. After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England where she continued to write until her death aged 77.", "title": "The Messenger (Armada)", "price": 7.19, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-64G57Q4L.jpg", "salesRank": {"Books": 5162854}, "categories": [["Books"]]}
