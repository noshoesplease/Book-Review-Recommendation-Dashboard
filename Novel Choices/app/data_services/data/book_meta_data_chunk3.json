He divides his findings into six main chapters representing the consequences of a one- to six-degree shift in temperature rise. More factual than hysterical and using accessible language, the author portrays a sobering, but broad and fascinating, view of the problem. He discusses not only the environmental consequences of melting icecaps, ocean warming, coral reef bleaching, CO2 emissions, deforestation, and severe weather, but also cultural and economic reverberations-the result of population shifts, animal migrations, and societal collapse. Through computer-modeling simulations he looks back into the past (the Pliocene, the Mayan civilization) and projects into the future for CO2 comparisons. His premise: the problem is now at global scale and will not just impact the disappearance of one group alone as it did the Maya. Claiming that solutions must be political, and that it is too late for quick fixes using renewable energy sources or technology, he concludes with some cautionary possible solutions: relocalization of goods and services, less consumption, global-scale carbon rationing, and a \"2 degree increase target.\" Anyone studying climate change will find this a helpful reference as much current research has been precompiled and interpreted within one resource.&mdash;Jodi Mitchell, Berkeley Public Library, CACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007233450", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The 2007 Nobel Prize in literature was a bloody disaster for Lessing, she recently told the BBC. This curious work&mdash;half fiction, half memoir, hampered by slapdash prose and an unfocused organization&mdash;may be the result of that unsettling time, when she said she didn't have the energy to write a full novel. The opening novella (the longer of the two pieces) is what might have become of her parents, Alfred Tayler and Emily McVeagh, if they had never married. The sluggish account of their parallel lives is notable mainly for Lessing's commentary on the changing economic, social and cultural mores in England before and after WWI. The second section is a rambling series of recollections that describe the family's failed farm in Southern Rhodesia. Lessing describes her mother's dominating personality, attributing her mother's smothering attention to her frustration at having given up a successful wartime nursing career and a vital social life to raise a family. Lessing's longtime readers will find little new in her autobiographical disclosures, and new readers will look in vain for the talent that won the Nobel. 11 b&amp;w photos.(Aug.)\"\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007231989", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The Pulitzer Prize winner and author of Brokeback Mountain portrays her flawed paradise in the majestic, hardscrabble West in this vibrant memoir. Proulx bought a 640-acre nature preserve by the North Platte River in Wyoming and started building her dream house, a project that took years and went hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget. In her bustling account, Proulx salivates over the prospect of a Japanese soak tub, polished concrete floor, solar panels, and luxe furnishings that often turn into pricey engineering fiascoes. The meticulous master builders she dubs the James Gang are the book's heroes. Though the house never quite lives up to its promise, it does inspire the author's engrossing natural history of the locale. Proulx drives cattle off of the overgrazed terrain; finds stone arrowheads; recounts the lore of the Indians, ranchers, and foppish big-game hunters who contested the land; and documents the antics of the eagles, magpies, mountain lions, and other critters who tolerate her presence. Like her fiction, Proulx's memoir flows from a memorable landscape where \"the sagebrush seems nearly black and beaten low by the ceaseless wind\"; the result is a fine evocation of place that becomes a meditation on the importance of a home, however harsh and evanescent.

{"asin": "0007230206", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy ofWolf Hallalong. --Anne Bartholomew--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Wolf Hall", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 871881}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81fKXcKlJML.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["125002417X", "0805090037", "0140174923", "0312426399", "0307947726", "0684843129", "0307743764", "0805062734", "0312426054", "0544228081", "1609450671", "0316055433", "0142004308", "1400031702", "0446556149", "0312427085", "1451626118", "0452295297", "067972477X", "0767913736", "0525952969", "0544142934", "0141439548", "0812976533", "0441013597", "0316176494", "0670024783", "0307455920", "0312429967", "031632468X", "1476764174", "055380653X", "0143125842", "1451666179", "0452282152", "0345349571", "0374534144", "0061950726", "038572179X", "048629823X", "0312199430", "0316074314", "1423631706", "0307387941", "0312330537", "0307476413", "1590171993", "0061565318", "1476746583", "162779073X", "0802122558", "0143126687", "0307743721", "0312541538", "0812982622", "0618249060", "1451681755", "0143105515", "1250037816", "0393244660", "0385754302", "1439195269", "0758278454", "1400095204", "1423622022", "0345807294", "0307744434", "1439153663", "0062065254", "0316206849", "1400079152", "055358202X", "1594203369", "0143124544", "0452296366", "0060883286", "0143125478", "0143124870", "0525953094", "1594632340"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8UZYOA", "0307947726", "1451666179", "1400031702"]}}

Eventually the travelers reach land, returning to Gunnar's previously established settlement. When Peer discovers the evidence of a murder, relations with the ruthless Vikings begin to deteriorate. After a near-deadly confrontation with Harald, Peer flees and finds refuge with a civilization based on the Native American Mi'kmaq people. They help him to recover and treat him with kindness. When it's discovered that Harald has cold-bloodedly murdered two of their warriors, the tribe is bent on revenge. Peer must find a way to free Hilde from the Vikings and shield her from the violence to come. Langrish skillfully weaves Norse and Native American mythology among the fantasy and adventure elements. Mythical creatures and mystical elements abound, and magic is an everyday part of the characters' existence. Peer and Hilde are now teenagers, and their changing relationship&mdash;from friendship to romance&mdash;is believably depicted. Fans of the first two books will enjoy this one.&mdash;Ginny Collier, Dekalb County Public Library, Decatur, GACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And the more he eats, the smarter he gets. When he starts eating too many too fast, he can no longer digest them, and their contents get all mixed up. The simple cartoon illustrations twinkle with humor and feeling. Done in paint and pencil on smart backdrops&mdash;pages from old books&mdash;the pictures set the stage for the quirky story. When forced to give up eating his favorite volumes, Henry eventually learns to enjoy reading them. However, an actual bite taken out of the back cover suggests he still succumbs to the occasional indulgence. This well-done package will charm its audience. The snappy text works well for reading aloud, but older children will enjoy exploring the subtle details hidden in the illustrations and backgrounds.&mdash;Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007254008", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Compelling characters compensate for a lackluster plot in L&#xE4;ckberg&#x2019;s latest thriller set in the remote Swedish village of Fjallbacka. This time around, veteran detective Patrik Hedstr&#xF6;m investigates a fatal crash involving a local shop owner. Hedstr&#xF6;m fears foul play when he learns that the victim, a teetotaler, had an astonishingly high blood-alcohol level.Turns out, a few unsolved cases over the years had similar circumstances, and Hedstr&#xF6;m considers the possibility that they are all connected. Adding to the detective&#x2019;s woes is an obnoxious reality show (is there any other kind?) that has descended upon Fjallbacka. Ratings climb through the roof when one of the &#x201C;surgically enhanced&#x201D; contestants, nicknamed Barbie, is killed. Could there be a murderer among the cast or crew? Meanwhile, Hedstr&#xF6;m welcomes a new member to the police force, smart and comely Hanna Kruse, whose psychiatrist husband has the unsavory assignment of counseling the reality-show recruits. Fans of L&#xE4;ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012), who ranks among Sweden&#x2019;s most popular authors, should enjoy the eclectic collection of personalities in this latest offering. --Allison Block--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The Gallows Bird", "price": 11.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 419244}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WUEQ2dqtL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007419503", "0007419538", "1451621868", "0007419570", "1605985538", "1451621744", "1451621779", "0007507496", "0007473214", "1605983306", "1451621795", "0804170649", "0007253990", "B006CDD1VO", "0385351372", "0345807154", "1250022061", "0525954023", "0142196835", "0307960498", "034580709X", "0452297907", "0670026328", "1451621760", "0007419597", "1400031516", "1439198926", "0525954015", "1605980927", "1400095824", "0385340788", "1476724024", "0307742989", "1402787162", "1447217330", "1400095832", "1611090997", "0062271601", "0802122647", "0312428588", "1590516672", "1611091012", "1616950102", "0307951154", "0385340796", "0307477401", "1616952083", "0547738757", "1400031559", "1250043999", "0142180815", "1400069491", "0007419554", "0544273397", "1250029406", "0385341016", "0307744639", "0316122556", "0804178747", "0142181315", "0525952896", "0062237187", "0099554976", "1569474532", "1250037743", "0307743187", "0312426380", "0525953493", "1400031575", "0425264602", "0544002180", "1400031540", "0547577524", "1451608527", "006232005X", "1477823123", "0307951162", "0312655479", "0425260453", "0525953884", "0345802527", "1616952989", "0316224553", "1905207670", "0062004808", "0312536925", "1400031567", "1611090970", "0307960471", "081299289X", "0684803860", "1250000394", "1250028582", "0062068423", "0307472841", "030745469X", "0525954007"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007419570", "1605985538", "1451621868", "1451621744"]}}

Though she offers conversions for most measurements, American cooks will likely be frustrated with her vague (or absent) descriptions of ingredients like \"flat mushroom\" (shiitake?) for Mini Mushroom Bruschetta with Rocket, Olives and Parmesan, and Smarties (the British equivalent of M&Ms;) in her Polka-Dot Cookies. Still, dishes like a kid-friendly Croque Monsieur, Chicken with Lemon and Honey and Pan-Fried Scallops with Truffle Beurre Blanc are on the mark, as are Baked Eggs with Chorizo, Cream and Cheese and sides like honey roasted parsnips. A lengthy digression on sherries, however, is likely to bore rather than inform, and a page devoted to fresh-squeezed juice is barely worth including. Too hit-or-miss to wholly recommend, entries like mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, brownies and burgers push it into dangerously pedestrian territory. Rounded out with quintessentially British tips (how serve tea and sandwiches, etc.) this will best be appreciated by fans of Allen in particular.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following a loose structure, Cotter wanders from topic to topic, from discussing the etymology of sea spinach to an early morning wild mushroom hunt with little transition. While this may frustrate some readers, Cotter covers a remarkable amount of culinary ground and eventually gets to all the major players in the garden, from root vegetables and tomatoes to multiple varieties of kale and the joys of fresh asparagus. Supplemented with plenty of recipes for dishes ranging from the familiar (Tomatillo Salsa, Field Mushroom and Potato Gratin) to the exotic (Nettle Risotto, Watercress Soup with Walnut and Sweet Pepper Salsa), the real treasures are buried in the text, where Cotter offers numerous riffs on standards like beets, and how to employ turnips in a curry. Readers accustomed to skimming will gloss over many of the jewels scattered throughout the book, but patient cooks will be rewarded with a renewed appreciation for their garden's bounty.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His setting career started at an equally early age, when he submitted puzzles to the Evening News, who offered two guineas for each successful puzzle. His business career, as a financial controller and director of several BP subsidiary companies, allowed little time for more setting until 1991 when Tim joined The Sunday Times team. He now sets crosswords for the Mephisto and Owzat puzzles in various newspapers. In addition, he was the joint winner in the Observer&#x2019;s monthly Azed clue-writing competitions for 2004/5.

{"asin": "0007277946", "description": "Following a recent trend, this attractive, cleverly-photographed recipe collection is dedicated to seasonality, organic ingredients and simple home cooking. What distinguishes it is its author's British accent; the co-founder of an English catering company, Abel's takes on Heekerbeeker Kedgeree and The One and Only Traditional Cornish Pasty look and taste like a weekend in Brighton. Other recipes show off New British Cooking at its most cosmopolitan: Venison Saltimbocca is a novel twist on an Italian classic, while Lemon Sole with Wine, Toasted Almonds and Capers exposes the Brits' deep connection to France. India also proves influential, in treats like Bombayed Jersey Royals, a snappy potato dish, or Calcutta Lamb Burgers with Radish and Yogurt Salad, a loving tribute to two former British colonies. There aren't as many desserts as one might expect-after all, Brits are known for their \"puddings\"-but the few included, such as Mulled Wine, Pears and Clementines with Dark Chocolate Shavings, are all winners. Divided by seasons, the text is generally easy to follow but hasn't been Americanized; certain British food terms (\"broad beans,\" \"courgettes,\" vanilla \"swede\" puree) may cause confusion.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He's mocked for his purchase ofVoguemagazine but he just can't resist poring over the photo shoots, enamored with the color, cut, and style of women's dresses. Dennis meets up with Lisa, the school hottie, who is two years older and also a fashion aficionado. She plays dress up with Dennis and convinces him to come to school as \"Denise,\" a French exchange student. Hilarity ensues as soccer-star Dennis, outfitted in an orange sequined sheath, complete with wig and makeup, attempts to pull off the ruse. This quirky comedy also has poignant moments between Dennis and his dad and brother. It's a quick read and Blake's stylistic line illustrations are the icing on the cake. All that being said, it's difficult to predict an audience for this book. Younger students may be turned off by the Briticisms, and it's a bit too juvenile for older readers.&mdash;Patricia N.

Atticus Perennis is a Roman of Greek ancestry and master of the trireme Aquila. Septimus Capito is one of the first marine Centurions. The two brothers-in-arms must confront both the vagaries of the Senate, with its backstabbing, self-aggrandizing politics, and the difficulties of developing the concept of naval warfare.

The collective future of the humans, elves, dwarves, dragons and other fantastical inhabitants of Deverry is in jeopardy. Savage Horsekin tribes escalate their bloody assaults on Northlands settlements in the name of their goddess, Alshandra. As apprentice wizard Neb struggles to come to grips with his past life as the powerful sorcerer Nevyn, the magical island of Haen Marn suddenly reappears from nowhere, and few can agree whether this bodes well or ill. With multiple simultaneous plot lines, many of them dealing with relationships in past incarnations, pacing and continuity wallow, and the ending is merely an arrangement of chess pieces for the complex endgame of the final volume (tentatively titledThe Silver Mage).(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007285973", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* Sorting through her parents&#x2019; possessions after their deaths, Mair Ellis discovers a Kashmir shawl that once belonged to her Welsh grandmother, Nerys Watkins. Nestled within the folds of this exquisite handwoven piece is an envelope containing a single lock of hair. Curiosity drives Mair to trace the history of the shawl, a quest that takes her from Wales to India. As she pieces together her grandmother&#x2019;s past, the two women&#x2019;s stories intertwine, transporting the reader between the Kashmir of WWII and the present day. The bulk of the novel belongs to Nerys, a missionary&#x2019;s wife whose undemonstrative husband urges her to spend the winter in Srinigar with a friend while he spreads Christianity in remote settlements. Nerys is forever changed in this romantic city, blossoming in an illicit affair while being swept up in the dangerous unraveling of another&#x2019;s. The consequences resurface nearly seven decades later, leaving Mair with a life-altering decision. An avid traveler and thorough researcher, Thomas brings the flavors and colors of India to life with vivid detail and develops characters so real one feels a kinship. An engrossing, intelligent, and satisfying read, this publication is the American debut of a UK best-seller. --Diane Holcomb--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Kashmir Shawl", "price": 11.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 708219}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/912HNTmZV6L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1451655827", "0062188518", "0143125435", "1476703558", "1594486433", "0007173547", "0007285949", "1451655789", "055359253X", "1468308785", "1476703574", "0007173520", "0062273450", "0767919378", "0307590445", "1571746854", "1847391400", "0061950726", "1250031613", "1849832889", "1476746583", "037597136X", "0805094490", "1451681755", "0451465822", "0451419480", "1605985724", "1451606346", "1849835314", "1496190459", "0758292759", "1439152810", "0451240464", "0758278454", "0099464861", "0670024783", "0316055433", "1611099285", "140913590X", "0399157980", "0143126474", "0758285752", "0062237195", "161218426X", "1612183328", "1402293313", "0345528689", "0749040262", "0452298393", "1552782492", "0143123920", "0062234463", "1616203218", "0061710245", "0062257846", "1590516400", "0451416635", "1477807675", "1451672799", "0307950433", "0988940833", "0062077309", "0316176494", "140227663X", "0452298385", "0749009012", "1451698984", "0399162178", "1594632294", "0778316211", "0062310771", "1402258615", "0345525558", "0425261263", "0062077880", "0062229311", "1496147111", "1611173914", "0099464837", "1439101124", "0062300377", "1250027861", "1439153663", "1611458315", "0143124544", "0758278438", "0062065254", "1451623496", "0142196991", "0991097505", "1476743509", "1400069491", "1250040779", "0143121103", "0778314391", "0345527275", "1476709017", "0452297648", "1472212746", "0142180548"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062188518", "1476703558", "1476746583", "0767919378"]}}

{"asin": "0007269854", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. At the start of L&auml;ckberg's haunting U.S. debut, the first of her seven novels set in the Swedish coastal town of Fj&auml;llbacka, biographer Erica Falck returns home to sort through her deceased parents' belongings and work on her next book. But this is not the same hometown she grew up in. Summer tourists are turning the former fishing village into a thriving resort, and Erica's controlling brother-in-law is pressuring her to cash in by selling the family home. The apparent suicide of childhood friend Alexandra Wijkner contributes to Erica's grief. Once inseparable, they drifted apart before Alex's family abruptly moved away, and Erica feels compelled to write a novel about why the beautiful Alex would kill herself. L&auml;ckberg skillfully details how horrific secrets are never completely buried and how silence can kill the soul. A parallel between the town's downward spiral and the fate of one of Fj&auml;llbacka's wealthiest families adds texture.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This time, he creates an intricate fictional world in which the tiny Sparkler&#x2014;Peter Pan&#x2013;like in his mischief, Ulysses-esque in his cunning&#x2014;holds together three separate stories. Tollins are tiny, nectar-eating woodland creatures with elf ears and wings but bigger than the fairies they casually use as handkerchiefs. They enjoy an idyllic existence until a fireworks factory is built in the village of Chorleywood. One of the Tollins falls into a rocket, producing the most bang for the buck ever witnessed, and the men of the village hunt the Tollins down to use as fodder for their fireworks. Parts 2 and 3 continue Sparkler&#x2019;s perils and escapes from prison, execution, and a runaway hot-air balloon. Sparkler is a self-made scientist&#x2014;it&#x2019;s great fun to see him using applied chemistry for fireworks, finding herbs for medicine, and discovering the first steam engine. Duncan&#x2019;s full-color illustrations and maps bring the world to witty life. A note at the end likens the Tollins&#x2019; fate to child labor during the Industrial Revolution. There is much to think about and love in this beautifully realized world.

As Alborough's (It's the Bear; My Friend Bear) words roll out in an infectious, hard-hitting beat with more than a few rhythmic surprises, he metes out his bold pictures in perfect accompaniment. A triptych of vignettes creates a slow-motion effect as the truck first strikes a rock, is then shown aloft, and finally hits the muck; close-up spreads focus on the exasperated characters attempting to budge the vehicle. With light-hearted tension, wry characterizations and lots of squishy mud, this tale makes for a quacking good read-aloud. Ages 3-6.

For some reason the scenes remind me of the Teletubbies and the surreal fantasy world that they live in. The Octonauts and their adventures will be easily loved by little ones but I find the illustrations are very inspiring for an adult too.&#8221; - Bella Dia&#147;I am always in search of children&#8217;s books that are slightly offbeat and unique. It keeps things interesting for the grownups and the kids...The illustrations in Octonauts are vibrant and detailed. They are the kind of illustrations that the kids stare at for a while, so they can find all the intricate story and character details that are not explained in the text.&#8221;- MamaLibrarian&#147;An important lesson is taught about not taking important things for granted. Are we taking important things for granted in our world such as our environment? Although the book appeals to young children, it has a wry sense of humour which will also appeal to adult readers. The illustrator is not afraid to be adventurous&#133;All in all, the book provides a feast for the eyes!... Meomi&#8217;s story will inspire discussion about issues as far ranging as underwater creatures, shadows, submarines, friendship, and traveling to different parts of the underwater world. Recommended.\" - CM magazine (Canadian Review of Materials)&#147;It's the myriad fanciful details in the intricate undersea illustrations that will attract kids, who may also have a bit of fun with the text's scientific-sounding language&#8221; &#150; American Library Association, Booklist&#147;I've been a fan of Meomi for a number of years and it's not surprising that her acquired craft as an illustrator, her attention to details and the passion shown to illustrating sweetness would take the form of children books. The characters have each a compelling personality and the story is a voyage in the realm of a very fertile imagination and the plot unfolds with page after page of visual goodness&#133;Mind you, if you're a serious illustrator, her books are a must have for study and reference.&#8221; - NetDiver--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The Octonauts &amp; the Sea of Shade.

This is a lovely, lively, anecdotal anthology of good stories about cycling for the millions more who have taken it up for sport, fun, health and wealth since the turn of the century. Favourites here must be the free-wheeling interviews with bicycle couriers, feral cycling and -- for those unable to walk on water -- the art of water cycling.'

With The Bicycle Book, Bathurst adds her voice to the call that we are now at the dawn of a new golden age of this versatile machine.'

The result--too many animals, not enough room. Just as Percy tries to sort out the tangled bedclothes, the animals panic upon hearing unearthly scratching from below the floor. Not to worry--it's only a mole, also seeking warmth, but during that intervening time each animal has discovered a cozy niche in Percy's messy quarters ideally suited to its needs. The illustrations are lighthearted and the penultimate scene of the cluttered room is a wealth of eye-catching details. Percy's bulletin board, with notes from Santa and an invitation from H. R. H. reveal Butterworth's whimsical sense of humor. While not breaking any new ground, this is an ingratiating if not exceptional wintertime selection. --Phyllis G.

Sir Rupert Triumff, the swashbuckling hero-or crude anti-hero-and one-time explorer, must ingratiate himself with the Queen in order to get permission for future voyages, and is commandeered to protect Her Majesty. The concept is clever and creative, and magic, treason, and Spanish grandees make for an entertaining read, yet the pacing-either bewilderingly fast or inert thanks to arch description-may throw readers off.

The Aberdeen, Scotland, police detective finds himself working two kidnapping cases that couldn&#x2019;t be more different. In the first, a mother-daughter singing duo, made famous on the TV show Britain&#x2019;s Next Big Star, is being held for ransom with the little girl&#x2019;s toes offered up as proof of their abductors&#x2019; seriousness. In the other, a junkie has gone missing, presumably due to her boyfriend&#x2019;s role in a drug deal. If Dark Blood (2011) suffered from slackness, then this installment finds MacBride roaring back to form. The crimes are breathtakingly awful, the pacing is breakneck, and the stakes are higher than ever. Indeed, when fallout from his actions lands close to home, McRae finds himself wracked by guilt far worse than his many physical wounds. Few writers can blend bantering humor with gut-wrenching violence without it feeling cheap. MacBride entertains while still offering food for thought about what we consume as entertainment: Why does the public weep for one missing mother, who may be a fame-hungry monster, while not caring about another, who may be a victim of circumstances? There&#x2019;s little comfort in this bleak ending, but still: brilliant. Bloody.

The situations are familiar: \"Out in the sandbox/you threw lots of sand./You ran from the slide,/after slapping my hand.\" Fans can follow the 10 dinosaurs by starting with their names and pictures on the endpapers. Expressions are expertly painted for humorous effect, including the defiant Tsintaosaurus letting water overflow onto the floor and the rollicking Pachycephalosaurus kicking the seat while mother is driving the car. The large, colorful spreads and rhyming text that is still a joy to listen to after repeated readings make this a successful storytime selection. Well-designed pictures and skillfully arranged words will entice newly independent readers, who will be challenged to find the dinosaur name hand-lettered in the illustration where the creature is introduced.

{"asin": "0007367880", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Eric Newby has never been bedeviled by practicality. Hence this  1,200-mile journey down the Ganges River, which the author undertook in  1963 in the company of his wife and an ever-changing crew of Indian  retainers. What moved him to take the trip? Partly it was the memory of  his military service in India more than two decades before. And as he  confesses, Newby has a lifelong and perhaps congenital love of rivers:  \"I like exploring them. I like the way in which they grow deeper and  wider and dirtier but always, however dirty they become, managing to  retain some of the beauty with which they were born.\" Few rivers grow  quite as dirty as the Ganges, which also goes by such nicknames asAtula(\"Peerless\"),Savitri(\"Stimulator\"), andBhinna-brahmanda-darpini(\"Taking pride in the broken egg of  Brahma\"). And few accounts of this mighty waterway could possibly be as  acute and hilarious asSlowly down the Ganges, which Newby first  published in 1966.As always, the author finds human comedy everywhere he looks. Take his  initial departure from beneath the Balawali Bridge, where a highly  emotional crowd has gathered to see him off:Two hundred yards below the bridge and some twelve hundred miles from  the Bay of Bengal the boat grounded in sixteen inches of water.... I  looked upstream to the bridge but all those who had been waving and  weeping had studiously turned their backs. The boatmen uttered  despairing cries for assistance but the men at the bridge bent to their  tasks with unwonted diligence. As far as they were concerned we had  passed out of their lives. We might never have existed.And so it goes, even as Newby and his crew run aground 63 times in the  first six days, or switch doggedly from boat to train to bullock cart  and back to boat again. His patience in the face of continuous disaster  is superbly entertaining, as are his attempts to mollify his  increasingly impatient wife, Wanda. Still, his gift for the farcical  slow burn never keeps him from relishing the terrain, or from recording  it in lyrical yet laconic prose: \"At about six the sky to the east  became faintly red; then it began to flame and the moon was  extinguished; clouds of unidentifiable birds flew high overhead; a  jackal skulked along the far shore and, knowing itself watched, went up  the bank and into the trees; mist rose from the wet grass on the  islands on which the shisham trees stood, wrapped like precious objects  in their bandages of dead grass.\"Slowly down the Gangesis  packed with such time-lapse portraiture, along with plenty of casual  wisdom about history, humanity, and (last but not least) conjugal life.  It's one of those rare voyages we only wish were much, much slower.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Slowly Down the Ganges", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 309313}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Jee3Jk6FL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007367759", "0864427654", "0684870193", "1590171659", "1857885953", "0142001007", "0864426054", "0864426275", "0375757538", "1590171667", "0141442077", "0449906140", "0812979656", "0002158663", "1582430152", "0618658947", "0007367910", "140003065X", "038533303X", "0679727140", "1616952687", "0007597835", "0345536258", "0143039725", "0143039644", "0312429967", "0007367929", "0007367872", "0812976533", "0007367511", "0812932528", "1597263869"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0002158663", "0142001007", "0007367759", "0864427654"]}}

{"asin": "0007344201", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Taking a break from his Logan McRae series, MacBride offers a stand-alone whose premise is pure, twisted genius. Ash Henderson, a big, bruising police detective in fictional Oldcastle, Scotland, has been chasing a killer who snatches girls before their thirteenth birthday, tortures them to death, and then sends birthday cards&#x2014;with gruesome photos&#x2014;to the girls&#x2019; families each year thereafter. The kicker? Henderson has been getting the birthday cards, too, but won&#x2019;t tell anyone his missing daughter is also a victim: if he&#x2019;s taken off the case, he&#x2019;ll lose his chance to catch the &#x201C;Birthday Boy&#x201D; himself. This has all the hallmarks of MacBride&#x2019;s best books&#x2014;gruesome violence, foul weather, pitch-black humor, and entertainingly mismatched protagonists (Henderson is paired with &#x201C;freak-show&#x201D; forensic psychologist Alice McDonald). But despite all this has to offer readers so inclined, MacBride needs an editor who&#x2019;s not afraid to use a knife, as the book feels about 100 pages and one plot twist too long. On the other hand, those who enjoy spending time in MacBride&#x2019;s dark world may not mind a bit. --Keir Graff", "title": "Birthdays for the Dead", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 422317}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XuXImjT1L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007344244", "0007362544", "0007419465", "0007344295", "B005IV0BHS", "0007344260", "0007419457", "0007342578", "0007419422", "0007560486", "0007419449", "0007344309", "0312940599", "0312949359", "B005EP2XSS", "0312382634", "0802122485", "1616148772", "0062004808", "0316224553", "0525954015", "1616147164", "1616147873", "0802122132", "0062219464", "0544319486", "0345533763", "0307960498", "0062240501", "0857382225", "0345807154", "034580709X", "0061986488", "0399162380", "031233995X", "0670026328", "1250036135", "0399162372", "0143123769", "0385351372", "1623650003", "1476744483", "031622460X", "0061990620", "1405913185", "1842999575", "0525952969", "0312359675", "0316188522", "1605985104", "1476724024", "0385348452", "1455517135", "0061990639", "0330546015", "1609450922", "0316224588", "0751545643", "0802122507", "0802121071", "0802145175", "0399165525", "B00969PYQ6", "0062271601", "1616950102", "0544319494", "0143119494", "0802146120", "0399166432", "0802122043", "1590200276", "0670026468", "0316188514", "0727883313", "0316069345", "0062227378", "0804170649", "0802126073", "0802145566", "0525954007", "0312643217", "0743289242", "0345547497", "0142196835", "0547792778", "0312384424", "0312614586", "0316069515", "0547738757", "0330518712", "0062237187", "000734421X", "1611090997", "006052524X", "1250007585", "039915972X", "161695230X", "1454901276", "0802121489", "1455504734"], "bought_together": ["0007344244", "0007362544"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007419457", "0007419449", "0007419465", "0312382634"]}}

But now he's traveling to Oden's Ford to earn an education in the magical arts, and it will not be without peril. Despite the fact that the academy is known as &#x201C;the great leveler,&#x201D; there are students who have reason to hate Han, specifically the Bayar twins, Micah and Fiona, because he stole the Demon King's amulet from their father, the High Wizard. To gain the upper hand on them, Han joins forces with a mysterious wizard he met in the dream world, but what this wizard asks in return may be more than the teen wishes to give. Meanwhile, Princess Raisa has fled from an arranged marriage with Micah Bayar. She and her loyal&#x2013;and beloved&#x2013;soldier, Amon, are also making their way to Oden's Ford so that Raisa might receive a military education in order to become a stronger ruler. Raisa's and Han's paths have crossed in the past, but when they meet again their connection is more powerful than before. Chima has created an intricate world with a rich history, cultural prejudices, and complicated political dynamics. Her characters are multifaceted: no one is either completely evil or insipidly perfect&#x2013;each has shortcomings as well as redeeming traits. Readers would do well to pick up the first book in this series before tackling this one, as there are some details that will be lost without knowledge of what transpired in The Demon King (Hyperion, 2009), but those who love a well-thought-out fantasy will enjoy this novel.Heather M.

Sisters Suki and Tess hail from an Irish town where the postmistress, Danae (a woman of mystery to curious townsfolk), is joined by her heartbroken niece, Mara&#x2014;romances ensue. Stories with four main characters are bound to be complex, and this one is no exception, but plots and subplots are well handled. Secondary characters are quirky and add to the reading fun. The omniscient narration covers 20 years in the lives of the women through flashbacks, artfully placed to shed a little light on present-day happenings and just enough information to ensure a suspenseful read. Kelly&#x2019;s readers will take comfort in her recognition of the humor in daily life, the necessity of friendship to women, and the strength of bonds among families. This modern-day fairy tale, which starts out sad and ends up just fine, will please Kelly&#x2019;s fans and appeal to more mature readers of chick lit. --Ellen Loughran--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.", "title": "House on Willow Street", "price": 10.38, "salesRank": {"Books": 1738736}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uPgI7Y%2BhL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0007240449", "0747260583", "0385351852", "B006CDEK6E", "1853717967", "0007156332", "0143118498", "0452283388", "1451616767", "1416564608", "B001P5HD54", "B001PO69G4", "B001PO69GO", "0007466935", "1402260113", "0747260575", "0755343875", "0755333861", "1444706829", "0857208969", "0007488238", "0330520539", "1782921966", "0007373678", "0755378407", "B003E7EW1O", "184983203X", "B0058M5CLM", "0241950589", "0060731486", "0755378431", "B00CY3B8GQ", "1402284403", "1402218338", "0593071514", "000743734X", "0752847953", "1844880699", "1250046343", "0755332520", "075289336X", "0752883496", "184744458X", "0752883526", "1409135470", "1476704511", "0340766891", "1782921982", "1849164185"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0007373678", "B005Q6ECLG", "B001PO69G4", "1476704511"]}}

{"asin": "0007388160", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Early one morning in February 2008, Oates drove her husband, Raymond Smith, to the Princeton Medical Center where he was admitted with pneumonia. There, he developed a virulent opportunistic infection and died just one week later. Suddenly and unexpectedly alone, Oates staggered through her days and nights trying desperately just to survive Smith's death and the terrifying loneliness that his death brought. In her typically probing fashion, Oates navigates her way through the choppy waters of widowhood, at first refusing to accept her new identity as a widow. She wonders if there is a perspective from which the widow's grief is sheer vanity, this pretense that one's loss is so very special that there has never been a loss quite like it. In the end, Oates finds meaning, much like many of Tolstoy's characters, in the small acts that make up and sustain ordinary life. When she finds an earring she thought she'd lost in a garbage can that raccoons have overturned, she reflects, \"If I have lost the meaning of my life, and the love of my life, I might still find small treasured things amid the spilled and pilfered trash.\" At times overly self-conscious, Oates nevertheless shines a bright light in every corner in her soul-searing memoir of widowhood.

{"asin": "0007419449", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. Relentless rain reflects the tormented mood that permeates MacBride's impressive debut set in Aberdeen, Scotland. Det. Sgt. Logan MacRae, back from a lengthy convalescence caused by a crazed suspect's knife attack, is plunged straightaway into the investigation of a brutally murdered child. To make matters worse, the victim's family learns of the death from a reporter before the police have a chance to inform them. Angered and embarrassed by the press leak, Logan, aided by WPC Jackie Watson, vows to expose the source within the precinct. Enter Colin Miller, flashy journalist, who befriends Logan, causing suspicious stares from Logan's superiors. More children go missing, and soon the populace of Aberdeen is screaming for blood. Further inciting the rabble, a notorious defense attorney earns acquittal for a habitual child molester. As a result, a hapless, ruined scholar&ndash;turned&ndash;street sweeper becomes a scapegoat for the chilling fear that grips the community. Logan must eliminate the distractions caused by the sensational publicity and summon his barely restored strength to anticipate the killer's next move. MacBride allows his characters their humanity, while weaving intriguing subplots in this edge-of-your-seat page-turner.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0007367759", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "For more than a decade following the end of World War II, Eric Newby  toiled away in the British fashion industry, peddling some of the ugliest  clothes on the planet. (Regarding one wafer-thin model in her runway best, he  was reminded of \"those flagpoles they put up in the Mall when the Queen comes  home.\") Fortunately, Newby reached the end his haute-couture tether in 1956. At  that point, with the sort of sublime impulsiveness that's forbidden to fictional  characters but endemic to real ones, he decided to visit a remote corner of  Afghanistan, where no Englishman had planted his brogans for at least 50 years.  What's more, he recorded his adventure in a classic narrative,A Short Walk  in the Hindu Kush. The title, of course, is a fine example of Newby's  habitual self-effacement, since his journey--which included a near-ascent of the  19,800-foot Mir Samir--was anything but short. And his book seems to furnish a  missing link between the great Britannic wanderers of the Victorian era and such  contemporary jungle nuts asRedmond  O'Hanlon.At times it also brings to mindEvelyn Waugh, who  contributed the preface. Newby is a less acidulous writer, to be sure, and he  has little interest in launching the sort of heat-seeking satiric missiles that  were Waugh's specialty. Still,A Short Walk in the Hindu Kushis a  hilarious read. The author excels at the dispiriting snapshot, capturing, say,  the Afghan backwater of Fariman in two crisp sentences: \"A whole gale of wind  was blowing, tearing up the surface of the main street. Except for two policemen  holding hands and a dog whose hind legs were paralysed it was deserted.\" His  capsule history of Nuristan also gets in some sly digs at Britain's special  relationship with the violence-prone Abdur Rahman:Officially his subsidy had just been increased from 12,000 to 16,000 lakhs of  rupees. To the British he had fully justified their selection of him as Amir of  Afghanistan and, apart from the few foibles remarked by Lord Curzon, like  flaying people alive who displeased him, blowing them from the mouths of cannon,  or standing them up to the neck in pools of water on the summits of high  mountains and letting them freeze solid, he had done nothing to which exception  could be taken.Newby also surpasses Waugh--and indeed, most other travel writers--in another  important respect: he's miraculously free of solipsism. Even the keenest  literary voyagers tend to be, in the purest sense of the term, self-centered.  ButA Short Walk in the Hindu Kushincludes wonderfully oblique portraits  of the author's travel companion, Hugh Carless, and his wife, Wanda (who plays a  starring role in such subsequent chronicles asSlowly down the Ganges). There  are also dozens of brilliant cameo parts, and an indelible record of a stunning  landscape. The roof of the world is, in Newby's rendering, both an absolute  heaven and a low-oxygen hell. Yet the author never pretends to pit himself  against a malicious Nature--his mountains are, in Frost's memorable phrase, too  lofty and original to rage. Which is yet another reason to call this little  masterpiece a peak performance.--James Marcus--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 327059}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81E52XRCwaL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0195325605", "0141442077", "0864427654", "0007367880", "0156031566", "0143039725", "0142437190", "0864426054", "0375757538", "1590171659", "0864426275", "158243171X", "1590171667", "0312622058", "0007597835", "0141442085", "0375727485", "081016065X", "0618658947", "1568360223", "0156027496", "1619491877", "1599218933", "0374514429", "0679727140", "0143039385", "1590177541", "0547255276", "1585427438", "0195030672", "0140094296", "1590172442", "0007367929", "159017187X", "0312278500", "0385291604", "0300163681", "0679737324", "0143105515", "0691154414", "0142437522", "1589880668", "0142001007", "0810160714", "1590171888", "1568361424", "0679762876", "0812932528", "0375724958", "0006544150", "0007367511", "1585747289", "159017674X", "1590173228", "1580084168", "1906011419", "0316923354", "0156032791", "1592287247", "1590206460", "0671400452", "0910395829", "0786714387", "039552105X", "0142401110", "1582432554", "0679722165", "067972902X", "1567923925", "0007367910", "1400033837", "1599210630", "0375755063", "1848853130", "0307958280", "0679776117", "019983265X", "0486203263", "0374126453", "0140255087", "0312421516", "0307948889", "0451530497", "0547237936", "061883933X", "037575640X", "0316358339", "0375725938", "0060505087", "1400031672", "1573226521", "1585679569", "0452259614", "0307474461", "0671695886", "1400078334", "0061231770", "0375714065", "0060596554", "0002158663"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0142437190", "0141442077", "0143105515", "0007367880"]}}

The author of such classics of travel literature as A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush and Slowly Down the Ganges takes the armchair traveler with him as he and his companion contend with misleading signposts, lonely roads, torrential rain, gale-force winds and unhelpful natives who describe any destination as \"up the road a bit\" although it may be circular miles away. As a result, the Newbys fall upon many culturally significant points by absolute chance. Trips to remote castles, holy wells and splendid ruins in the west of Ireland are enlivened by lashings of Guinness and tea, and by the often antic behavior of the locals met in omnipresent pubs. The Newbys, who live in England, returned to Ireland in the summer, when travelers are more expansively welcomed and more places are open, but it is their winter tour that captures the essence of the country and its delightfully idiosyncratic populace.

She also discovers a Nazi war medal with the diaries and asks a retired history teacher to examine it. Within days, the teacher is bludgeoned to death. Then Britta, Elsy&#x2019;s closest friend as a teenager, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s, is also murdered. Through the diaries, Erica intuits that the solution to the mystery is rooted in events that took place during WWII. Once again, L&#xE4;ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012) employs Swedish history and her setting, Fjallbacka, the postcard-pretty village where Falck grew up, to craft an engaging tale that spans three generations of Fjallbackians. The author goes deep into the lives of a very large cast of characters, and some crime lovers might balk at a 520-plus&#x2013;page novel that is almost half family saga.

{"asin": "0007398549", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gregory's sixth novel moves from her usual historical fiction (A Respectable Trade, etc.) to a contemporary tale that treats familiar, middle-class domestic ground with a horrific tilt. Every Sunday, Ruth and Patrick Cleary, a young English couple married just four years, visit Patrick's parents in Bath. Both Ruth and Patrick work in news production, but even in the common area of career the balance of attention tips heavily toward Patrick. Ruth feels like an outsider in the close-knit Cleary family, and Patrick and his parents are oblivious to her pain. Orphaned since childhood, Ruth has always yearned for love and a sense of belonging. In the first flush of passion, Patrick promised these; he even promised to help Ruth recover her lost childhood by traveling back to her childhood home in Boston. Snugly married and absorbed by his career, however, Patrick has lost track of his wife and his promises. When the cottage at the end of the lane from his parents' manor house comes up for sale, he sells the Bristol condo Ruth loves without a thought. Ruth soon becomes a poster-girl for co-dependence: she loses her job and unwillingly becomes pregnant. After her son is born, she sinks into depression, allowing her mother-in-law to take over completely. Finally, she is manipulated into a \"rest home\" where she becomes zonked on antidepressants. Hitting bottom, Ruth rallies, only to take control of her life in a joltingly twisted way. Gregory writes smoothly enough, but her insights into the dysfunctional family are only pedestrian, laying fallow ground for a surprise ending that neither horrifies nor enlightens.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Little House", "price": 71.95, "salesRank": {"Books": 837857}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61jt72szkuL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0006511775", "1416593144", "0007145896", "1416590889", "0743272544", "1416563717", "0743272528", "0006514650", "0743246071", "0006496423", "0743272536", "1442453451", "0743249305", "0743249291", "145162607X", "1451626088", "1442476885", "1451626096", "1451629559", "0743249313", "0544222881", "1416549145", "1442453443", "0743269268", "0743272498", "1439124671", "1402224680", "1476746303", "0743227441", "1442476877", "1402265581", "1476735484", "0778314316", "1402250924", "1451626118", "075153840X", "054422292X", "1442476915", "1451629540", "0544223403", "1439170657", "145162610X", "1442476907", "1451633246", "1435122623", "141655047X", "0451236807", "145165684X", "0671634623", "0778328791", "1402214316", "0671535323", "074327251X", "B0064X92RY", "1402219024", "B0058M7Z1C", "0751540269", "0451237897", "1451648626", "0345495349", "0345495365", "1402244495", "1416563709", "0751538116", "0758271387", "0062361007", "0671701517", "1482702371", "0345434870", "1556524048", "0345511891", "1439183163", "1402241372", "1476703558", "0345408772", "0060176636", "0061094331", "0312312911"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1451626088", "145162610X", "1451626118", "1416590889"]}}
