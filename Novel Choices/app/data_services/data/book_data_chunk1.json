The first involves a young, depression-era  veterinarian who loses his parents in a car accident just days before taking his final exams. His father, also a vet, had mortgaged his practice to the hilt to pay for his son's Cornell education. At loose ends the boy hooks up with a circus.The second has to do with the same man, now a miserable nonagenarian confined to a senior citizens home. He gets into a \"fight\" with another old man who claims to have carried water for the elephants. You don't carry water for the elephants; you take the elephant to the water. One would think the first story would be more compelling since the circus is a world of its own with its own language and culture, but it's really the ninety-year-old who wins our hearts. His \"people\" come to see him every weekend, but he doesn't really know who they are; he doesn't remember if he's ninety or ninety-three. But he does remember the circus.The circus story is kind of hokey. Almost immediately the young vet, Jacob Jankowski, falls in love with Marlena, the star of the equestrian act. The problem is she's already married to the animal trainer, who just happens to be a paranoid schizophrenic. He's also insanely jealous. Then there's the elephant, Rosie, who only speaks Polish; Camel, an alcoholic  roustabout who helps Jacob get a job with the circus; and Kinko, the dwarf, who at first is an enemy of Jacob's but later befriends him when Jacob cures Kinko's dog Queenie of the trots. The book does come to life periodically when Sara Gruen uses real circus lore. For instance, Uncle Al, the circus owner, loves freaks. He takes the circus train on a wild ride when he has a chance to employ Charles Mansfield-Livingston, a man with a parasite twin growing out of his chest, whom he calls Chaz.Gruen also provides numerous real-life circus pictures, one of which is especially titillating. She got them from STEP RIGHT THIS WAY: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDWARD J. KELTY and WILD, WEIRD, AND WONDERFUL: THE AMERICAN CIRCUS AS SEEN BY F.W. GLASIER.Gruen keeps you turning pages, relying on a couple of suspense elements. Does Jacob get the girl, and does Jacob, the nonagenarian, get to see a circus one last time?  I had a bit of a problem with Gruen's ending.

The movie: The two are combined into August. Verdict: The movie got it right. Uncle Al is an under-developed character in the book. The movie gives us one villain who is more menacing, especially as portrayed by Christoph Waltz.The book: Marlena gets pregnant with Jacob's child. The movie: She does not. Verdict: The movie steered clear of the hackneyed device of having the woman in the pair of star-crossed lovers get pregnant.The book: We are taken back and forth in time from the present of the old Jacob to the past of the young Jacob. The movie: Scenes with Jacob as an old man bookend the story. Verdict: I have mixed feelings about this one. The passages focused on Jacob as an old man are poignant, insightful and empathetic. Some of the best storytelling on being old I have ever read. I would enjoy an entire book based on those passages.

A linear telling of the tale, start to finish, would have been much better.I'm not sure what was gained (if anything) by the dual voices of young and old narrator, but I suspect it was done for \"literary effect\".

When we meet Jacob, he is in his 90s, living in a nursing home and reliving his days with the Benzini Brothers circus. It was through a chance encounter after the death of his parents that caused him to leave veterinary school and put his fate with the circus.I was really surprised by how quickly the story captured my attention. The novel jumps back and forth from \"now,\" where we see Jacob dealing with the trials of old age, and \"then,\" as he remembers his days with the Benzini Brothers circus, and how those days formed him into the man that he would grow to become. The sequences are fluid, though, and you find yourself easily swept along with the story. Sara Gruen's prose is amazing; I found myself on several occasions holding my breath, I was so wrapped up in the story. Gruen clearly portrays her characters emotions and captures each of their voices and personalities perfectly and her portrayal of the lives of the circus folk in the 1920s-30s was very grim. It was amazing to me that so many people would live that kind of life, but I guess when that was the only work to be had, they'd take what they could get.Gruen seems to have done her research as well. Even though the Benzini Brothers circus is fictitious, I think it was clearly influenced by any number of circus' in operation at the time. She also makes reference to several actual circus events (such as the Hartford Circus Fire of 1944 and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train accident of 1918). Even down to the band playing \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" during an emergency, Gruen seems to have done her homework on circus life.If you haven't read this yet, I'd really recommend it.

In this case, the scene is the American traveling circus of the early 1930's, just after the start of the Depression. The protagonist operates in two time periods, as a nonagenarian in a current day \"assisted living facility\" and flashing back to his days as a young veterinary student who due to circumstances beyond his control ends up serving as the vet for a traveling circus. Gruen intended to imagine various vignettes for the book, but in her research and interviews with circus veterans discovered stories from real life that were even better--a real-life case of truth being stranger than fiction. The assisted living facility is inevitably less interesting than the world of freaks and geeks in a circus, but Gruen handles the voice of the aged just as deftly as that of the young vet.  The book is enhanced by actual pictures from various circus archives.

I wondered if it would pick-up and it did--when the same character went back to being in college.  It took longer to set the stage than I expected, but the book kept me listening all the way to the end.  And even though I liked the younger character better--it was much more interesting than listening to the older character, it ended with the older gengleman.  It was a surprising unexpected ending, that made it all the more worthwhile for waiting for it.The setting was a seedy travelling circus set in the Depression era in the US.  Some parts were sad, the disposable people to the circus owners, and the treatment at times of the animals.  The reader brought it all together--the main character, and I truly enjoyed this book--not one I would normally be intersted in or buy.I might have been able to skim by the slow parts if the book were in paper form, not audio, or if the chapters were shorter in the audio book.  That was my only complaint in this book.  SOme things were drawn out too much.It was a sad happy story, but unlike Oprah's books, good prevailed overall and the majority of the time--in the story and in the ending.  It was a hard time for America and for the small time travelling circus, and those who lived that life.  It's a good read.  I might have enjoyed it more in hardback, then the 93-year old voice and pace would not have grated on me so much, or dragged so much, else I would give it a 4-star, but not 5--it has some slow parts that drag it out too much.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Water for Elephants a compelling read--I listened all the way", "unixReviewTime": 1305590400, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2011"}

I was amazed and enlightened by all of the details of an early-20th century circus and all of its inner workings.Secondly, the novel is told from two different perspectives.  One is a 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski, who is an ivy-leage educated animal doc and recently \"orphaned\", while the other perspective is a  90(or 93)-year-old Jacob, whose days are spent in a nursing home, longing for the days of his youth.  Both perspectives are equally compelling and entertaining, and they come together to reveal mysteries about the story in the end.Speaking of mysteries, I loved that there was a twist that totally caught me off guard in the end.  These always make for great pleasures if done right, and Gruen's  surprise delivers a punch at the end that I wasn't even looking for.I already am waiting for the mention of film rights to this one.  It screams movie all the way through.  Not just because of the amazing story and characters, but also for the potentially incredible set design, costume design, and stunning visuals.  The elderly Jacob would be a great role for someone in the winter of their years and the flashbacks between then and now just yearns to be filmed.Finally, the characters in this book sold me.  Every one of them is a real treat.  As you might imagine, the characters in a circus are, well, real characters, and those from The Benzini Brothers circus is no exception.  Jacob, upon accidentally joining this troupe, discovers real evil, unlikely friendships, and the love of his life.  The characters are not exaggerations or caricatures like another unnamed circus novel I have read.  These people are empathetic, realistic, funny, and fascinating creations you won't soon forget.Get a copy of this novcl today.

I will say that the circus atmosphere was conveyed with incredible, and apparently accurate, detail and I was impressed by that. I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus.  However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a \"nice guy\" with little personality.  In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling.  I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf.  The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people.  However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing.  Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read.

Because of the hard economic times, his parents mortgaged everything to pay his tuition and thus he was left grief-stricken AND penniless. He ends up joining the Benzini Brothers by an accident of good timing and, because of his vet training, he ends up hired on to care for the horses and other animals. Along the way, the circus owner purchases an elephant named Rosie; she becomes a special part of this story.Author Sara Gruen weaves a tale of hooking the rubes into coming to the show, second-rate performances that managed to wow the audiences, boozy nights, in-fighting among those with the train, backbreaking work, and other fascinating details of the traveling circus. Jacob quickly assimilates into the hard life and makes the mistake of falling in love with Marlena, one of the performers who has a sadistic husband.

It had been recommended to me both by Amazon and by people I know, but I never gave it much thought because I'm not really a fan of the circus, but having just finished it (in a day and half) I am very glad I picked it up.Others have summarized the book sufficiently, so I won't go there, but I will say that from the prologue to the last page, you are invested in this book and the characters and care what happens to them. The story is told by the main character in his nineties who is in a nursing home, looking back on his life and how he got to where he is. The prologue is of the climactic event in his life in the circus, and then the rest of the book alternates every few chapters between his first hand accounts in the present in the nursing home and his first hand accounts in the past as a youth in the circus. The scenes from the present in the nursing home force you to sympathize with a man whose body is old but who is mind is young and the struggles associated with such a circumstance, while the scenes from the past in the circus are a window into the past that show you who this man used to be.This book had a captivating beginning, and satisfying ending, but my only problem, and the singular reason I didn't give it five stars was that in the middle, the story was just a tad slow. However, don't let that discourage you from reading it because, as you can see from my title, that only warranted a half-star reduction from me because this really is a great read as a whole whether you love or hate the circus and I recommend it full-heartedly to lovers of a good story.PS: For a novel with a completely different plot, but with similar execution (telling the story by alternating between present and past) and a fantastic five-star story, try Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A 4.5 star book with only one tiny problem...", "unixReviewTime": 1177891200, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2007"}

Although readers will get lost in the invented world in this book, they will also learn a great deal of real facts about the Depression, train circuses and animal behavior along the way.  And they will feel the plight of Americans in the grip of economic panic in ways that most history books cannot convey.  Photographs at the beginning of most chapters both illustrate the plot and confirm that most of this unbelievable story really did happen.  I particularly loved learning about the mechanics of circuses, how they were set up, taken down, how the crowd was shaken for every last nickel, how they performers and animals were fed and housed.  The paperback edition contains an interview with the author and other notes that describe the research that went into the book and reveal that a few of the more amazing events in the novel actually occurred.  As if the glamour of old circuses weren't enough, this book also contains a second story set in present day about an elderly man in a nursing home.

The alternating story between the daily life of a 90-ish year old man and his cantankerous behaviour with his youth as a circus vet kept my attention; the details about the social heirarchy between members of the circus was (on the authority of a former circus roustabout friend of mine) accurate; and I have to admit, I am a sucker for a love story.  However, as previous reviewers have noted, the 1930's vernacular, and the mannerisms of men of that era were abhorrent - but then I am a stickler for these kinds of detail.The story - of a Cornell vet student who quits his final exams before graduation to join the circus and his subsequent adventures (and love story) has undoubtedly caught the imagination of the vast majority of Amazon reviewers - including myself.  Yet I deduct a star because of the lack of attention to detail regarding the male protagonists and the verbage of the time.  For most readers, this apparently isn't an issue, in which case I would stronlgy recommend it.As far as breezy summer reads go, this certainly fits the bill - who *hasn't* fantasized about running off with the circus?

In the days of the big top, there were lots of menial jobs that kept those who wanted to be part of the circus busy from before dawn into late into the night, even if those jobs often involved nothing more glamorous than shoveling up the remains of an elephant's snack.Water for Elephants starts with an elderly (at least 90 years old) Jacob Jankowski remembering snatches of his past as he frets over the indignities of living in a nursing home while his children ignore him except for token rotating visits on Sundays.  One memory in particular stands out, a violent memory that he didn't share with anyone for over 70 years.Most of the book moves through flashback into the 1930s when America was broke and people were starving.  Into this challenging world, Jacob has high expectations as he finishes up his veterinary training at Cornell.  But the hand of God intervenes, and his life will never be the same.He soon finds himself serving in any role that he can get at BENZINI BROS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH (as the rail cars read).  This isn't the big time.  It's just surviving by staying one step ahead of the local sheriffs while not delivering on promised acts and providing entertainment for men that has nothing to do with being a circus.  This circus doesn't even have an elephant.Much of the story involves the nitty gritty of how circuses operated in those perilous times.  It's a story that encompasses lots of cruelty, deceit, and harshness.  In fact, it's enough to make you wonder why you ever dreamed about running away to join the circus.  So if you would like to keep that dream shiny, perhaps this wouldn't be the best book for you to read.At the center of the story are three people and one elephant.  Marlena is the queen of the circus, the star of the equestrian act that involves first 12 and later 10 horses.  She's married to the volatile August who runs the animal acts.  When Jacob becomes involved in caring for the animals, Jacob is invited to dine and party with the couple.  The relationship becomes more complicated when Jacob finds himself drawn to Marlena and repelled by August.  When the circus buys an abandoned elephant that seems unusually stupid, the equilibrium is destroyed.Ultimately, the book is about responsibility and loyalty . . . qualities that are more important in and taken more seriously by the circus world than by the \"rubes\" who attend the circus.  The message will serve as yet another indictment of our modern world which favors efficiency over doing the right thing.The book is beautifully illustrated with vintage photographs of early circuses that nicely match the story line of Water for Elephants.Unlike many authors of such historical fiction, Sara Gruen does a good job of keeping a few surprises up her sleeve.

I loved the narrators, they really added something extra to the story. Also this story is meant to be told orally and listening to it really makes it all come to life.I was a bit worried when I decided to listen to this book. I don't usually like books that involve animals, mostly because of the guaranteed heart fail. Not only does this book have animals, it is set in a circus. Having worked as a zookeeper, I learned some of the not so nice things that happen to circus animals. Then add to it, the story is set during the Depression. All of these had me cringing a bit. But who hasn't dreamed of running off to the circus?I was hooked in the first few minutes of the reading. I could tell that it would be a story I would lose myself in. I have to say though I was a little annoyed with the music playing in the background. Particularly with the older narrator as it made it difficult for me to hear him clearly.Oddly enough, it was the scenes of the older Jacob that had tears coming to my eyes, rather than the animals. It sucks to be old and his story is probably far more common than not. Though I did cringe every time August had a scene with Rosie. I was also a little shocked at the debauchery that took place at a circus (today it is such a family event).The descriptive nature of the story had me feeling like I was there at the circus. I could smell the popcorn. hear the cheer of the crowd, and when I closed my eyes I was in the menagerie with all the sights and sounds that come with a tent full of animals. More so than any other audio book I've listened to, there was a mini movies running through my mind.I went to see the movie a couple of days after finishing the book. I don't usually like to see the movie version so soon after finishing a book because the details of the book are so fresh in my mind. But I have to say, the movie was so well done that I fell even more in love with the story. The movie left out the parts that I found annoying in the book (in particular the back and forth between the old Jacob and young Jacob). I do have to say that I was a tiny bit upset that BoBo was cut from the film.

He doesn't remember how old he is or even the people that take turns coming to visit him.  But what he does remember more than makes up for his current state of boredom.  The beginning reminded me of Stephen King's \"The Green Mile\".  The author obviously had to do a great deal of research into circus life during the depression in order to write this book.  What she found does not make a pleasant story.  Being an animal lover, the cruelty displayed toward the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, really disturbed me.  I still have a hard time believing that Jacob, who had nearly received his degree as a veterinarian and loved Rosie, would not have done more to prevent it. The cruelty displayed towards the employees was just as bad.  Railroad goons would actually push workers off moving trains in the middle of the night rather than pay them.  I thought the affair between Jacob and Marlena was not as torrid as it should have been.  Rosie was my favorite character - she was described in human terms which made the cruelty more difficult to endure.  In the end, both the peon workers and Rosie got even.

Dusty, stinky, hard work, low pay, railroads, animals escaping, fat ladies, dwarves, clowns, all of it.

Other than that, reads beautifully, the images in between chapters appeared fine and crisp, dictionary functions well.Water for Elephants is one of those big, entertaining read that is packed with action and wonderful details, and, of course, a love story. From the first few pages there you get a clear sense that the story is just tailor made for the movies. The structure of the narration, the intricate period details as well as the classic twists and turn of the plot makes you feel like you are, quite literally, reading a movie. I could even hear faint soundtrack music in the background as I flipped through the pages!Jacob Jankowski, Ivy League vet science student, found himself on the road after his life is turned upside down by a freak accident. He made a fateful jump on a passing train, which turned out to a travelling circus. Soon after, he finds himself employed as the circus vet and falls head over heels for the star of the troupe, Marlena, who just happened to be the wife of the schizophrenic head of the menagerie. Then one day, an elephant joins the troupe and everything started to unravel.The love story itself is filled with cliches. Young man falls in love with a woman out of his reach, thinks his love in unrequited but can't help to yearn for her and therefore continues to woe her. And just when he thought his chances are gone, she confesses that the feeling's mutual. Aha, what about the evil, schizo husband? Well, they go through heaven and hell to escape him and that's basically it. The love story.And so it's not a surprise that the characters are not of great depth. Jacob is the naive, testosterone-bursting young fella who knows what or who he wants but doesn't have a clue how to get it. And is showered with luck and good friends to support him. Marlena, is the charming damsel in distress and her husband the wicked yet brilliant villain.But all those flaws, as great as they seem, are overridden by Gruen's superbly paced and gripping storytelling of a magical world of a bygone era. The world of the travelling circus in the 1930s she described just sucks you in. The lack of depth of the human character is replaced by the depth of character of their animal counterparts. Rex and Leo, the lions, Bobo the chimp and Rosie the Elephant. The story just came alive with all those great period details.Also, despite of the predictable outcome of the love story, it is the structure of the narration that keeps you glued until the last page. Gruen zooms back and forth between Jacob's old self, a miserable 93 yo in a nursing home, wifeless and seen as a mere duty to his family and his young self. The way old Jacob yearns for life is all too familiar and is echoed in the young Jacob's lust for life. Ultimately, you want to know what happens to both Jacobs: Will the young Jacob win his love, and will the old Jacob regains his peace of mind?Finally, this is not high literature.

I mean cmon!  It's a nearly 5 star book! Except that it never did.  Not even when it go the \"exciting\" part.One reviewer mentioned that it seemed as if the author realized they need to \"wrap it up\" and hustled the story along.  Where a day in the beginning took several pages, when it finally got to the \"good stuff\"...it was all done in a few paragraphs or very few pages.  It was an ok read at best, but it's not a 5 star book.  A 5 star book should be a book that consumes you and stays with you when it's over.  This book simply didn't do that.  It told a story, wrapped up and ended.It almost seemed like the author didn't really connect or have real grasp on the characters when writing the \"past\" parts.  When she wrote about elderly Jacob, it was spot on and you really felt what Jacob was feeling and got immersed into his world.  While when reading about young Jacob, you feel more like you are just reading a story about someone.  For me the best books are those that put you in the world of the character, and for whatever reason, Sara could only do this in the present storyline.Also, the ending of the present day Jacob was a little lackluster I thought, and completely unrealistic.  It kind of took away from what good the book had.Bottom line:  it's an ok read, but I can't say that I'll be going around recommending it to my friends or anyone who asks about it.COMPLAINT:  Before I reviewed this Kindle Book...it was $5.00.  When I bought it, the price had gone up to $6.39.  I noticed that the cover changed to the \"movie one\".  This seems RIDICULOUS since Kindle readers don't really have a use for covers.  Also, the original book has old time pictures of circus people.  The Kindle version does NOT have this, because the movie book doesn't have them either (I checked in a local store). Which makes sense in that you can't have a movie cover with pictures that don't relate to the movie so they were evidently removed.  But I was not happy that I paid more for a book with less just because two actors now grace it's cover on an ebook.

The year is 1931, jobs are scarce, and, as Jacob quickly discovers, Uncle Al, the show's unforgiving ring master, and August rule the circus with an iron hand. Performers are treated well, but working men often go unpaid or worse, are \"red lighted,\" or thrown off the moving train in the dead of night.

When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with \"jake walk\" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book.

With creatures of every variety in need of his services, Jacob becomes part of the Benzini Brothers, a circus dying to be Ringling Brothers and as we learn, their management, headed up by Uncle Al, a brute in anyone's managerie is ready to literally dump dead weight and steal what he needs to drive that train where he wants it to go. Jacob endears himself as a necessary component and survives the late night \"redlighting\" that makes roadkill of certain colleagues.Love springs eternal as both young and old Jacob encounter women who make the journey worth hanging for. When the elephant comes to town, the men of both eras are drawn closer still and we can feel their joy, their pain, their passion writ in every color of the literary rainbow. Ms. Gruen clearly has a passion for the subject and has researched every nuance and trick of the period(s) and the ride is a rollick. Certain characters pop in without much preamble and we feel genuine pain for little Walter and his doggie, and for Casey, the victim of \"the Jake,\" an ailment wished on no person. The deepest sympathy is felt for the largest of creatures, Rosie, and we wince at every poke of the trainer's prod, every command misunderstood and yet she's not why we bought a ticket to the show.Water for Elephants avoids the traps of a parable, or a fairy tale, or a moralistic thriller, and we're left with what we came for: a well paced story filled with great characters who remain there after the day ends and by the end of the ride, it's a Book for Everyone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Zoom", "unixReviewTime": 1212019200, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2008"}

I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.

The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.

For all Gruen's indepth research into circus life of the 1930s, the atmosphere of the narrative felt wrong. The dialogue sounded far too contemporary and the stage directions -- \"I looked out the window\"; \"He moved his jaw before answering\"; \"I looked steadily at her then looked away\"; and the dramatic \"in the distance I heard the sound of a camel\" -- were intrusive. Add to that the constant  cutting back and forth from young-buck Jacob to retirment-home Jacob and you feel not that you're immersed in another world, but rather reading the script of a touching Hallmark Theater production.The characters are from central casting: the good hearted whore, the tyrannical boss, the crazy husband and his sweet but long-suffering wife. And the noble hero. Young and bereft of family, Jacob stumbles into circus life and is hired as a vet. He is painted as the champion of the small and weak, regardless of sex or species, always wanting to do good and right. And yet, at the moment when his friends need him most, he's gone, taking their only means of protection, a knife, with him. And the elephant for whom he professes deep affection he leaves to the hands of a crazed maniac, to be beaten not once but twice, and our hero does nothing about it. How can we possibly cheer for him?Too bad the story wasn't told from the POV of a minor character named Greg. Greg shows up twice, first when he retrieves the elephant using what he knows she loves, booze. He shows up later ministering to her wounds from one of the beatings. He's speaking Polish to her, the language she understands. Why did we need Jacob?

Some of the characters were hardly developed, Marlena mainly. There were moments I found to be quite crude and crass. However, somehow I know that years from now I will look back at this read fondly.My best guess is that I just liked the voice found throughout the novel. In fact I would go so far as to say the narration was superb. I have always been a fan of first person and while the bulk of this story is in fact first person, Gruen superbly weaves a sort of third person narration. The transitions are so smooth that you barely notice the shift. Gruen is just a superb narrator or maybe it's Jacob who does the great job?Now for a few thoughts on the film; I have four words, don't waste your time. If the narration and not the actual story is what makes the book then it is a no brainer that a movie would fall very short. This film was really not good, at least from where I was sitting.

Perhaps it's because I'm rapidly approaching the age where I could end up in a nursing home myself, but that part of the book fascinated me. It's from the perspective of a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It rang true.  I was touched by the nurse who treated him like a person, who explained things to him, and cried with him when his family failed to show up to take him to the larger-than-life event he had looked forward to throughout the book--the circus.  It made me think back over the experiences with our own parents and wish I could go back and do things differently.The other part of the book, the flashbacks into this man's history were fast-paced and exciting.  I immediately sympathized when, as a young man, he lost his parents and found himself alone in the world, and understood his running away from it all. Maybe I question the believability of one or two points while he traveled with the circus, but not enough that it marred my enjoyment of the book.  I simply took it as an indication of how much things have changed in this country over time. What would not fly now might have at one time. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to become absorbed into any society (even the world of a traveling circus)  and how to survive, a person must abide by rules they might otherwise never consider.  The book showed the higher and baser aspects of human nature, all of which I found easily believable.  The world is filled with people who have differing stories and problems.  We don't all behave the same or believe the same, but we do conform to the ethics of our individual worlds--good or bad.  I believe the author demonstrated that  beautifully.I read some of the other reviews, and was saddened that some people couldn't see past  the imperfections and simply enjoy the different facets of the story.

It was one of two best books I've read in the past year.  In fact, it probably ranks as one of my favorite books of all time.  It was expertly, yet simply, written by Sara Gruen.  The novel tells the story from the perspective of Jacob Jankowski who currently resides in a nursing home.  The story alternates between Jacob's current living situation and the story of his past, how he once worked in a circus during the first part of the 20th century.  The impending visit of a traveling circus next door to the nursing home prompts him to remember the details of his circus life/experiences when he was a young man.Gruen's description of the nursing home, its residents, and its day-to-day activities was spot-on.  Having visited my grandparents on several occasions in their nursing home, I could easily visualize and relate to Jacob's experiences.  It really came to life.You can tell that a lot of research was also put into the circus recollections of Jacob Jankowski.  Gruen delves into circus life in the early 20th century when circuses traveled via train from town to town, and animal welfare and regulations were little more than an afterthought.  I found all of Jankowski's experiences intriguing and actually felt like I was experiencing them right along with him.  The characterizations felt realistic, too, and I could easily distinguish between the many different circus workers, and even some of the more prominent animals.It wasn't until halfway through the novel, though, that I realized how the nursing home is a metaphor for the circus.  Gruen makes subtle comparisons between the animals in the circus and the residents of nursing home.  They're both herded, fed, and prodded.  Jacob even says, \"I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person.\"  So true.  And sad.Now that I've read this fantastic book, I'm very eager to see the forthcoming movie adaptation.  I'd like to say that I'd love to see a sequel to this great tale; however, I think Jacob Jankowski's story has already been told in full in this one well-crafted novel.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Water for Elephants, Candy for Readers", "unixReviewTime": 1300665600, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2011"}

In many ways, I felt the same way reading Sara Gruen's fast-paced and engaging story. It is an oddity. It is wondrous. And it also has some plodding, filthy elements.\"Water for Elephants\" starts with a grippping prologue, during which we see the murder of a circus employee in the 1930s. The story then switches back and forth between young and old Jacob, a man who gets pulled into the circus life, discovers love, adventure, and trouble, and then reflects back on that as an old man. Gruen does a fine job creating this empathetic character, though the old man's story becomes less important and almost campy by the end. The young man's story delves deeply into circus life, with lots of interesting details and conflict, although the characters are all fairly black and white, with the villains being obvious and predictable. For some reason, Gruen also seems compelled to give us lurid details of the circus striptease and Jacob's own loss of virginity at the hands of the \"cooch tent\" prostitutes. Why these elements are described in such detail only detracts from the already shallow love story to come. It would be nice to see some intellectual dialogue between our male and female leads, rather than coy glances, \"shapely calves,\" and the surface attraction of teenage relationships.Soon, Jacob's background in veterinary studies allows him to find a place onboard the circus train, during which he falls in love with Marlena, a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. When the circus procures a new elephant for its act, it provides a link between Jacob and Marlena, as well as with Rosie the elephant. The problem is the jealous and psychotic August, Marlena's husband. We know he must be removed from the picture for this to work. Deeply ethical and moral issues come into play, but Gruen chooses the easy route and solves the problem in a somewhat satisfactory but highly implausible way. This is only underlined by the equally implausible solution of old-man Jacob's frustrations. Sure, it's all warm and gushy, but the deep research and texture of the circus and some of its elements give way to romanticized solutions that turn a historic novel into one of borderline fantasy.With all the fanfare over this novel and tie-in movie, I suspect I'll be accused of being the blind man here in my description of the \"elephant.\" Many elements were strong and well done, but much like Sebold's \"The Lovely Bones,\" all of the wonderful storybuilding gives way to a conclusion that feels a bit forced and too easy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A \"Blind Man's\" View", "unixReviewTime": 1305676800, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2011"}

An old man, either 90 or 93 - he can't recall - lives in a desultory, grumpy funk in a generic nursing home, treated like a product, given impersonal but efficient care, and regularly visited by a vaguely attentive, dutifully loving, but clueless family. He is lonely; he misses his wife; he longs for attention from his prolific family, but understands that they have problems of their own. For solace, he relives his early life on a continuous thread - his life as a circus veterinarian for a second-rate travelling show.In alternating chapters, the author, Sara Gruen, takes us from the present to 1931 and back, showing us a rich history of a good young man whose life is changed forever when his parents die in a car crash, leaving him destitute just as he is to stand for his final exams at Cornell. He had hoped to go into practice with his father as a small-town vet; instead, at a total loss, he bolts, jumping a train which turns out to belong to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (or words to that effect). He is plunged into the colourful, quirky world of the circus, with all its different intensities and personalities; at risk of being summarily thrown off the train, he is reprieved by Uncle Al, the owner/operator/ringleader of the circus when that gentleman learns that Jacob is - for all intents and purposes - a vet, something Uncle Al has coveted for a long time.Jacob falls easily into the life, loving working with the animals, learning to become one of the circus family, and finding an unlikely friend in the dwarf whose living space he shares. Along the way, and almost immediately, he also falls hopelessly in love with the wife of Uncle Al's right-hand man August. Marlena is the woman of the horses, directing her own act with 12 beautiful Arabians in the ring, and her grace and beauty completely captures Jacob. He must tread carefully; her husband, August, is borderline insane and insanely jealous.The old Jacob buries himself in these memories, frets over the static life of the nursing home, and learns to look for one particular nurse who seems to be the only person who really takes an interest in him. She counsels him gently; she brings him food that is just a little better than what he's been getting; and we get a glimpse, through his eyes, of the frustration of the elderly, trapped inside a body that won't cooperate anymore and surrounded by people who aren't interested in his bright former life.This was an absorbing, entertaining book, a complete joy. Well-written, well-researched, it opens a door on a world that most people never thought about and makes the different subjects into real people.

Written from the point of view of the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, we find out how he is thrust into the world of circuses after he experiences a life-changing tragedy in his family, the death of his parents in an accident. The book goes back and forth from the present, with Jacob being in an assisted-living home, to the past, where Jacob boards a train and then, after being almost booted off, begins his world of traveling circuses aboard the Benzini Bros. With nowhere to go, and nothing to do, he begins the circus life, meets several of the key characters, such as Walter, Camel, Marlena, August and \"Uncle Al.\" While Gruen's ability as a storyteller is there, I felt like the book was a letdown because of the direction it took with the main character.One substantial element to Jacob's personality is his connection and compassion for animals, but I felt like there were times when he isn't the strong leading character he could be, and that this compassion for animals is inconsistent. For instance, there is a point after becoming the Benzini Bros. personal veterinarian, he indicates that his protection for animals is unbending saying \"...and what my father would do--what my father would want me to do--is look after them, and I am filled with that absolute and unwavering conviction.\" Yet, there is at least one instance when Jacob has a chance to stop the villain August from abusing Rosie, the elephant, but fails to take any action, despite how ruthless he knows August to be. Odd, considering that he makes some rash decisions, but none that are of much consequence.It also seemed odd to not focus more on the circus itself, as it pertained to Jacob and many of the other characters. Why not focus more on the spectacle of the circus, the performers, the competition between the rival circuses, and the pageantry of the event?  The potential to do this seemed to be there, especially the way the 93 year old Jacob reflects on the sweet memories of being in the circus, telling many workers in the hospital about those wonderful days with teary-eyed conviction.  Instead Gruen uses much of the book's energy on the \"forced\" relationship and wooden love affair between Jacob and leading circus performer Marlena, August's wife. I mean, if you are going to write about the circus, and do the research on it, why not concentrate more attention on events that involve the history of the circus. There was a pronounced shift to the love affair between Jacob and Marlena, especially in the novel's second half, and much of the dialogue between the two seemed hokey and silly. It made the book come across as a romance disguised as a circus story.Still, it was an enjoyable and relatively quick read. Gruen's ability to detail scenery and hook the reader into a story is present from the beginning to end and her writing flows smoothly. This is the kind of book that has many redeeming qualities, and makes for a good topic of discussion.I just wish the book wouldn't have \"sold out\" on a silly love affair; the potential for much more was there.3 1/2 stars", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Engaging writing, but too much focus on love affair", "unixReviewTime": 1198368000, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2007"}

I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals.

He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning. Although I wanted more emotion between Marlena and Jacob, it's a romantic story, full of action, love for animals and a magnificent circus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Oh My Books!

She has more than studied it she has affectingly captured it in Rosie, a large gray elephant and the one hope of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a down at the heels circus trying to make a go of it during the Depression.Now, Rosie wasn't too much of a hope because she was lovable but could not follow any command .  Rosie's only unique characteristic was a seemingly unquenchable thirst for  lemonade.  Her inability to perform was no excuse for the intolerable cruelty visited upon her by August, the callous menagerie director who thought nothing of tossing a lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth.  He didn't limit his abuse to helpless animals but also mistreated his lovely wife, Marlena.Spellbindingly read by David LeDoux and John Rutledge Jones, Water For Elephants is at its heart the story of three - Jacob, who has lost his parents in a tragic accident, and finds a home with the circus, Marlena and, of course, Rosie.  It's a poignant look at their lives set against an oppressive, sometimes degrading circus world, and a look back at our country during the grueling Depression years.  Most importantly, it's a reminder of the resiliency of human beings and how love can heal.- Gail Cooke", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A REMINDER OF HOW LOVE CAN HEAL", "unixReviewTime": 1149724800, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2006"}

Characters who have known each other for a very short time share passion and requited love for one another, vowing to be together forever when one of whom is still married.Some details like the villain being Jewish are completely impertinent to the story but makes you why exactly the author did that. The protagonist is lovable and portrayed in very positive light throughout the novel, but his actions are just as villainous and psychotic. At one point where the protagonist gets really jealous he climbs on the roof of a moving train while carrying a knife in his mouth, intending to kill the villain in a very really Indiana Joneseque segment that makes you giggle at how superficial the author's line of thought was.Without revealing too much, it's very close to Moulin Rouge, only without the interest, tempestuous music and theatricality.

With the recent release of the movie, I decided to pull my copy on loan from my bookshelf and read it before venturing out to the theater to see the movie (or, more likely now, renting it).Water for Elephants is definitely different from the other fiction I normally read.  The book takes place after the Great Depression, and Gruen did a lot of research surrounding circuses during that time to influence her book.  Many of the chapters began with a picture from circus archives, which really added to the experience of reading the book.  I absolutely loved how the chapters alternated between the main character's experience in his early 20's as the circus veterinarian and as a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It really made me think about the stories of my own grandparents, who are nearing their 90's themselves.The diverse cast of characters in the circus also made the drama of circus life a fascinating read.  I had no idea of the caste system in circus life, the treatment of employees and animals alike, and how competitive circus troupes were during this challenging era in U.S. history.I have heard that the book is better than the movie.  I admit that I am a bit skeptical about the movie given some of the casting choices for its main characters.  But, like any avid book lover, I do intend to see the movie to see how it compares to one of the best books I've read so far this year.

Soon he discovers that the circus has so much to offer, and it's own perils as well.

The man who still remembers his days at The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.The story was well crafted and encompassed all the different elements of life in the circus.

Some deeply moving, others barely creating or leaving the slightest ripple in my conscious brain. Some, seemingly, with the power to change the way I see things or think about things...sometimes subtly, and in others there are major thought differences after finishing the book. This book has affected me deeply.The last book to touch me this way was some months back when I read \"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank\" by Thad CarhartThe Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelierwhich I heartily recommend to you.With \"Water for Elephants\" Sara Gruen creates the long-forgotten days of the Train Circus, and all that life entailed in those days...from the impossible \"set-ups\", \"knock-downs\", and in many cases \"hasty retreats\" from any particular chosen town before the authorities arrived upon the scene.\"Hard Luck Days\" certainly would be a fitting genre to place this awesome story into. And, of course, with the depression, etc., they truly were hard luck days, for everyone involved with the exception of perhaps Uncle Al with his penchant for stealing, skimming, using and abusing everyone on the show. We also come to know August and his sickness that continually creates misery and unhappiness both for him, and also for those closest to him. There is Marlena, August's wife and performing partner with her performing horses, and later her act with Rosie the Elephant (a charming, and all-knowing wonderful beast if ever there was one). There are dozens and dozens of other characters, distributed throughout all levels of the show, from performers right on down to the dung-shovelers and the guys who do nothing but put up and take down the tents for the big top, day in and day out endlessly, working like dogs for sometimes nothing. We meet the midget clown Kinko also known as Walter and are shown into his rather twisted life, and also we meet Camel, an unfortunate, for sure, addicted to and dying from Jamaican ginger paralysis, a common and cruel death from drinking bad alcohol. We meet and deal with the sadistic Blackie, and witness his ways with dealing with those \"done with\" on the traveling show.Sara Gruen has created a most wonderfully \"real\" environment and \"time\" for this story to inhabit, one that clearly allows one to \"see\", \"feel\", \"smell\" and \"witness\" at what seems \"first hand\" how life was for those who lived \"the Big Top life\"....a marvelous talent for a writer. If she were never to write another story, this one, surely, would guarantee her a place in the literary hall of fame....a beautiful, touching, funny, serious, deeply moving look at circus life in the 30's, and also a peek today into Jacob Jankowski's life as it is, and luckily, also, what it is about to become again.Truly, this is one of the Finest books that I have had the pleasure to read....a Perfect 10!Incidentally, Sara Gruen's new book is coming out within a couple weeks, titled \"Ape House\". Luckily I received an advance copy from the Vine Program to read and review, and I will be starting it just as soon as I finish here with this review of \"Water for Elephants\".Sara Gruen....You may never read this, but I wish to Thank You, personally, for giving us this truly Lovely, Wonderfully Entertaining book.

The story is told from the perspective of Jacob as an elderly man and Jacob as a young man.The relationships that Jacob forms during this excellent novel form the corserstone of the story.  I found myself caring about a grouchy dwarf and his 3-legged dog, as well as an elephant, and a cast of numerous colorful characters.  The evocative descriptions of the circus itself - the Benzini Brothers; a wannabee Ringling Brothers - during the Depression; actually put you on a railcar with the smell of dust all around you.  This is certainly no glamorous lifestyle, and Gruen does an exceptional job of providing vivid imagery.  The menagerie that Jacob helps care for are an important piece of this wide ranging cast that features individuals that are easy to hate and aome that are easy to love.  Jacob meets Marlena, who is married to the evil August, and the relationships that ensue become increasingly complicated.I now know more about circuses that I ever knew I wanted to.  I am glad that I do, because the learning was all part of the great fun to be had here.  This is a very entertaining and compelling book.  I could not read it fast enough, yet I felt myself wanting to slow down to enjoy it all the more.  I rate this a highly recommended 5 stars.

So when \"Water For Elephants\" was loaned to me with a recommendation, I put off reading it. The movie, which I didn't see, got underwhelming reviews, which made me postpone it further. I think I read two new mysteries before finally picking up this book.And then was I surprised.  I loved it! It is imaginative and takes me into the wonderfully described world of a 1930's third-rate train (traveling) circus. If this world seems a little grungy, I remind myself that at the beginning of the 1930's, only 10% of rural homes had electricity for hot water heaters.  Animal rights?  Nonexistent. Workers' rights? Taking its first baby steps.  Occupational safety - don't make me laugh.  Bigotry?  How can fiction be worse than the truth. And over it all, the Great Depression, with it's unrelenting desperation.And these are illustrated in a heckofa story. The plot doesn't just advance, it gallops, it whoops. It has romance, but not implausible romance. Jacob Jankowski is the protagonist, telling the story, with a great last-minute twist, in flashbacks that I thought were handled well. As a matter of fact, the only part of the story that was too unrealistic for me was Jacob's rush to run away from all he knew - to literally, though unintentionally, run away to join the circus.

Good books do that do me. And this was a good book.Brilliant, actually.That's the best way to describe it. The words themselves, the characterization, the anticipation. It's brilliant.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is the story of Jacob Jankowski at twenty-three and at ninety (or ninety-three). At twenty-three, he ran away and joined the circus after his parents were killed in an accident. He had been studying to be a vet and was all but final exams. In the circus, Jacob encounters brutality, unexpected kindness, and love. At ninety (or ninety-three), Jacob's in a nursing home.The story fits well with Resurrection with it's themes of dignity, redemption, and anticipation. Twenty-three-year-old Jacob's Resurrection scene spread the resurrection and transformation to others. The Jacob in the end of the book is different from the Jacob in the beginning, and his transformation allows him to step in and fight for others. He may not always succeed in the way he desires, but he hands resurrection to others. It's a story about coming home.It's a story about dignity. Gruen frames the story so that you are hit by the fact that this old man, left to drool over Jello his last few years, is the twenty-three-year-old Jacob in the circus. These stories aren't just stories. They're stories of people we've forgotten about. It made me remember sitting at tea with my grandmother listening to her stories. I wish I'd written them down.It's about the dignity of the outcasts. In Depression-era America, especially on a circus, midgets, drunks, and the bottom-of-the-barrell working class were the outcasts. They weren't \"needed\" in society. They were easily disposed of. Because of this, Jacob becomes a Christ-figure restoring the dignity of a midget and a drunk, fighting for the oppressed, both human and animal.Gruen's strongest point, I think, is her ability to build anticipation. One scene captures it: Grady has (bad) news for Jacob. In waiting for Grady to spill it, Jacob notices the two drops of grease leaking from Grady's hamburger. Brilliance in these little details. The reader (namely, me) wants to shake Grady by the shoulders and scream at him to tell already!It's also about what Gruen doesn't write, where she holds back. I think as writers, sometimes we think we have to fill in every detail. For example, in a fight scene, Gruen doesn't give a blow-by-blow. Rather, she focuses on the confusion of the protag (Jacob), his swirling thoughts, a moment of pain here or there, his inability to stop hitting. Rather than observing the fight as you would a movie, you're caught up in the hero.

A time when a plethora of men out-of-work combined with a plethora of families looking for amusement and a modicum of freaks. Let's face it: throughout history, mankind has been sprinkled with a modicum of physical and mental freaks. Their ability to find job satisfaction fluctuates, but they're always out there.(Caveat: As a child in Wisconsin, I certainly attended a circus or two, and dutifully watched the now-defunct Great Circus Parade on TV, but have never visited the Circus World Museum in Baraboo. I am just as much an outsider as the rest of you, unless you are a Flying Wallenda, in which case I am a much bigger outsider.)The circus of Water for Elephants is the (name of circus), which is certainly a mouthful. To the eyes of this non-Flying Wallenda, it appears to be pretty typical of the time, especially once it gets an elephant. More on that later.II. PlotJust a brief synopsis here, since you have likely seen the film, read the book, or are planning to do so. Jacob Jankowski (protagonist), runs away to join the circus after his parents die in a car accident. Perhaps unwisely, he does so just before finishing his veterinary degree. He meets August, the bipolar head trainer. He falls in love with Marlena, August wife. After the circus picks up an elephant named Rosie, Jacob uses his profound understanding of animals (and the Polish language) to bond with her. And with Marlena. Since August is a total jackhole, though, this relationship is doomed.Luckily for everybody, the circus owner (Big Al) is known for cutting corners, and his spendthrift ways end in total calamity. The animals get loose, August is trampled to death, and Jacob sweeps Marlena off to live happily ever after. They have children, he works for a real circus (Ringling), and end up ditching the nursing home for yet another circus.III. CharactersI couldn't help but picture Robert Pattinson in my head as I read this book, and I hated that. Same for Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz. Nothing to be done, but I wish it had been left to my imagination.Though I found the premise a little unbelievable on the whole (literally running away to join the circus?), I did empathize with Jacob. Preparing for a profession that requires you to stick your hand up a cow's butt is hard enough. Once your parents are tragically killed? Forget about it.The Jacob/Marlena/August love triangle didn't convince me either, but perhaps that was residual cringing from Jacob's sexual awakening facilitated by the ladies of the cooch tent.(I should also apologize to the man sitting next to me on the bus that one day. Sir, if you happened to notice that I was reading about a man getting deflowered, I DO APOLOGIZE.)Honestly, the character I liked best was old Jacob. (No, my favorite was not the elephant. I did not cheer when she killed August, nor at the many times the reader was reminded that ELEPHANTS ARE PEOPLE TOO. Save it for Greenpeace.) Old Jacob, an imperfect narrator, combined the indignities of old age with a fierce desire to keep living. He doesn't remember how old he is, nor which of his many relatives was supposed to take him to the circus camped next to the nursing home. But he's feisty enough to scoot himself over when no one else will, and it's that same sort of self-determination that won us two world wars, darnit!*wipes tear from eye*Maybe I'm just nostalgic for the grandpa I never had. It's like that scene from The Royal Tenebaums, when Royal reads the gravestone of a man who died heroically on a sinking ship. The viewer is led to believe this is a relative of Royal's. He then says something like, \"What a man. I wish I knew him.\"Well, I wish I knew Jacob Jankowsky. After he finished all that silliness with the circus.IV. StyleGruen uses a framing device, in which the bulk of the book is recalled through the eyes of the now-aged main character. The parallel? Present-day Jacob is eagerly anticipating a trip to the circus, whereas past-day Jacob worked many years on a circus. I do love the framing device, confusing as it is when you start the book. (More or less than in medias res? Discuss.)I appreciate a single protagonist/point of view kept constant throughout the book. I would not have liked to read a chapter told by Marlena, or the elephant, or the dwarf. It's hard enough keeping these people (and animals) straight with just one narrator.The ending was a little tidy for my taste--I kept expecting Marlena to miscarry or die in childbirth. That their long and productive union disappointed me probably speaks more to my own predilection for dystopian fiction (where EVERYBODY dies) than Gruen's storytelling abilities.The pacing was good, and you definitely knew when the book climaxed. I appreciated the real-life archival circus photographs scattered throughout, as well as the small details of circus life: the cookhouse flag, the water buckets, the segregation of performers and labor. Who knew that 50,000 people were paralyzed after drinking Jamaica ginger extract? Not me, even after watching the entire first season of Boardwalk Empire. HBO fail.Conclusion:Water for Elephants is a \"slice of life\" novel. In this case, Depression-era circus life. My criticisms aside, it's a worthy read.

The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to \"run away\" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.

It's gripping and complex, with some wonderfully written supporting characters such as Walter, Camel, Uncle Al and Rosie the elephant. The tension slowly builds between the central characters, but is relieved with some laugh-out-loud moments from circus lore. The story is told in flashbacks from a 93 year old. There are some truly poignant moments at the nursing home. This is a really unique, well-done and entertaining book, and I liked that I couldn't guess the ending.Cons:Virtually non-existent and what there is is nitpicky, but here goes... It's written in present tense, which takes some getting used to. On p. 147: \"A black boy offers to shine my shoes.\"  My 98-year-old grandmother uses the term \"colored\" and I believe that was the common term in the `30s and that \"black\" was a '60s term.

I often write that most books need to be shorter. Novelists seem to always come up with a great opening. Better ones have great endings. Most fail in the middle. That middle third of most novels is such a bore to me. I think it&#8217;s filler to beef up a word count. I didn&#8217;t find this in Water for Elephants at all. Gruen can structure a story and keep the pace going. That&#8217;s a terribly hard thing to do and she pulled it off wonderfully.With one glorious exception, however, the characterization fell flat for me. Did I care about the characters? Kinda. Did I care about the romance? No. What did touch me was the role of the older Jacob. How this young, female writer climbed into the head of a ninety plus year old man, I&#8217;ll never know but his thoughts and actions rang true. He was facing death but still facing life and his inner monologue caused an almost claustrophobic feeling in myself. My god, I kept thinking. This could very well be me - trapped in a body, aware that I&#8217;m losing my mind to age and, most frightening of all, without the ability to do a damned thing about it. I hope to elicit that kind of reaction in a reader one day.The parts of the novel confined to an old man doing nothing much more than sitting in a wheelchair will stick with me for a while.

Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc..  The romantic scenes were very campy.

The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters.  The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book.

Themes of the book include romance, good vs evil, depression era desperation, and life in old age.The main character is a well studied near-graduate from an Ivy league school who loses everything after a catastrophe and feels he must run away and happens upon a circus train. He ends up working in very rough conditions to survive, and struggles with a love triangle that puts his life in peril.My personal affection for the book lies in the brutal conditions desperate people will endure, particularly for those who feel they have no place to go, as some of these characters do.  I'm also very fond of the contrast of how the elderly protagonist struggles with trivial tasks, like wanting to eat a crisp apple, while his younger self survived through such turbulent times.

A tender love story recounted by a nonagenarian in present time.USA, 1930s. Jacob Jankowski had it all planned out: about to become a veterinarian, looking forward to join his father's practice, fate disrupts everything. Almost overnight, he is employed in a circus, the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Animals love him and he loves animals, but not only. He falls in love for the very first time in his life. But love, just like wild animals, can be dangerous if one is not too careful, and it slowly dawns on him that all the glittery world of a circus is not always what it seems...The book is written in alternating chapters between present day and the past. The present day is represented touchingly, moving in a few parts, although the main character Jacob, now mostly sitting on a wheelchair with a few aches and pains, still has a sense of humour and a passion for life that is uplifting. He is now ninety. Or ninety-three.The chapters about his past are absorbing and mesmerizing not only because of him falling in love for the first time with lovely Marlene, they also offer an engaging insight of circus life, the workers, the animals, and what is behind all those lights and delights.

I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read. However, other than that maybe I was expecting too much but this book is overhyped and frankly way overrated.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Overrated !", "unixReviewTime": 1291334400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2010"}

One gets the sense that the author seeks to evoke some sympathy for the 90 year Jacob's plight. In this endeavor she fails as she never fully fleshes out his relationship with his children. Thus the reader is left feeling slightly apathetic as to his plight as a lonely and ornery old man wasting away in a assisted living facility.Finally, the ending is a bit contrived and convenient. The frail old Jacob making a break for it out of the retirement home and going to the circus event that is in town. There of course he meets and befriends one of the circus directors who spirits him away on their cross country tour.

So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me.

I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book. Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here. The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider. We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains. Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and \"Uncle Al\", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page. For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish. I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well. Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater. He's simply too many things rolled into one. Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable. And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic. Perhaps if she'd actually used the \"show, don't tell\" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional. As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man. One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do. Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook. It's hard to respect a character like that. Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram. In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action. I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story. Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book 4 stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man. I also really got a kick out of the ending.

Leaving aside the over-the-top, sappy, happy Hollywood ending, these sequences are satisfying and believable.The larger narrative, that of Jacob in his twenties, also has an air of authenticity, at least in terms of feeling (to an outsider) like a dingy, dangerous, depression-era circus.

If you answered \"yes,\" then this book is for you. If you answered \"no\" then this book is for you too. There is something for everyone in this tremendously well-researched novel of schizophrenic madmen, a possible murderer in pink sequins and a towering heroine who happens to be addicted to lemonade. What could be more fun?A depression-era circus can be the best place to be if you're Jacob Jankowski and you just buried your parents, found out they mortgaged everything they owned to send you off to veterinary college and ultimately you had nothing left to lose.Some of the central themes of this page-turner are to follow your instincts, stay true to what you believe in and try to survive no matter what. It's the what part that kept me flying through the book. The story shifts back and forth from Jacob at ninety (or ninety-three--he's not sure) to his incredible life on the train with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth--the circus! By incredible, I mean that there is a constant fear-factor woven underneath every nuance, every situation is rubbed raw in not ever being entirely sure of just what the future holds, or even if Jacob has one. That dread is dolled out in buckets-full by the head honcho of Benzini Brothers--Uncle Al--who can have you \"red-lighted\" (tossed off the train) for any number of indiscretions, or simply to lesson the load. The incredible part is that, in the end, Jacob not only manages to become the circus veterinarian, he also gets the girl, a bereaved dog, one elephant (Rosie) and eleven horses. Who could ask for more, you ask? Jacob Jankowski, that's who.Then there are the animals. A team of \"Liberty\" horses, lions and zebras and llamas, giraffes, chimps, panthers, and Rosie--the elephant--the Polish elephant no less. The elephant that, like all elephants, drinks far more water than anyone could ever imagine carrying, which is one of many parables in this fast-paced tale.Did I mention the train? Benzini Brothers traveled exclusively by steam-train. The train becomes a powerful force that literally grabs up entire, failing circuses in its path and absorbs them like the little fish being eaten by the bigger one.Think shark.Uncle Al is a \"take no prisoners\" kind of fellow, unless he can get you for a song. Then he owns your soul.The secondary story line, that of old Jacob looking back on his days with the circus, added a depth to this novel rarely seen in most modern literature. He may not know his exact age, but there is a spark of life in him not quite ready to waste away in the nursing home that has become his prison. Then a circus comes to town and begins to set up shop right next door to the nursing home. It's an opportunity that Jacob simply can't resist.You won't believe what happens next...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Oh My Gosh---Finally---A Happy Ending/Begining...", "unixReviewTime": 1281657600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2010"}

Conrad Guest\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "An interesting premise, Water for Elephants: a melodrama that takes place in a traveling circus during the first half of the last century. Throw in forbidden love, an abusive husband, murder, and a few other plot twists, and you're assured a best-seller followed by a Hollywood movie with a topnotch cast.I went to the circus as a boy; I never wanted to run away with it, but I enjoyed it; then again, I never feared clowns.I've had Water for Elephants on my reading list for more than a year; it was highly recommended to me but it just kept getting pushed down on my reading list. Finally, with the movie due out, I opted to make reading it a priority.I won't say I didn't enjoy it, but I can't say either that it's deserving of all the accolades it's received. Author Sara Gruen obviously had a passion for the circus, as evidenced by the research that went into this piece and the period.Normally I enjoy melodramas--Victor Hugo's Laughing Man comes to mind. But Elephants, for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, just missed.Maybe it's just me. Some call Romeo and Juliet the greatest love story ever written. I happen to think it's the most overrated piece of literature ever penned. I mean, come on, Romeo falls instantly in love with Juliet the first time he ever lays eyes on her, and only after they part does he realize he forgot to ask her for her name. Can true love be founded on such a shallow premise? No, he's just reacting to hormones. It's young love, which is not really love at all, merely lust.At first I thought it was because Ms. Gruen wrote the piece from the perspective of a male protagonist, and like a lot of cross-gender writing, it somehow lacks a certain authenticity. But Jacob is a likeable enough young man, flawed; recently orphaned, he joins the circus to what we in the 21st century would say, \"Find himself.\" He certainly is attracted to Marlena, initially, for all the reasons a 20-year-old young man would be: she looks great in her pink sequined riding costume.But it wears old after a while--we want to see a relationship grow between them. What the story reveals is that Marlena, married, suffers from Battered Woman Syndrome. Her husband is mentally unbalanced and jealous to the point of insanity. He accuses her of infidelity with Jacob even though nothing has happened--except in their own mercenary hearts.Well, we were ready to impeach Jimmy Carter for admitting he'd lusted after women in his heart. Even the bible teaches that if your thoughts are impure, if you're unfaithful in your mind, you're just as guilty as if you'd committed the act. But nothing has happened between these two innocents except a shared kiss. But because her husband is such a beast we accept that it is okay and feel sympathetic toward Marlena since she is committed to make it work with her unbalanced husband because her parents previously told her, when she wanted to come home after admitting to them the marriage had been a mistake, that she had to lie in the bed she'd made.Yet I found neither Jacob nor Marlena very sympathetic; neither character was very memorable, even if the writing was sharp, crisp and authentic to the period. My sympathies lay with Rosie, the poor elephant who suffered such abuse at the hands of Marlena's husband she, the elephant that is, eventually killed him.Now that I've had more than a week to think about Elephants, to capture what seems to be an elusive reason for my indifference to this book, it occurs to me that a lot of books these days are written in this fashion, they expect the reader to connect with the character in their own way.I understand what that means and I don't disagree with it--until it's taken to an extreme and I'm presented with cardboard characters, caricatures.I want to connect with characters, not become them. I want to see how others respond to adversity. I can always later compare what I would've done, how I would've thought, were I in those circumstances.I guess, in the end, that's what was missing for me in Elephants: I just couldn't connect with Jacob or Marlena.Or, maybe at my age I just don't get young love anymore.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice Scope; Characters Fall Flat", "unixReviewTime": 1304899200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2011"}

I kept hearing great things about it, but I just had no interest in reading about a circus. Then I saw the movie preview... and knew I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie (I'm rarely able to finish a book if I see the movie first). So I started reading, and had a hard time getting into it at first... I think this was mainly because I felt like I HAD to read the book... as if I was back in school! I eventually got past this and was able to get immersed into Water for Elephants.Usually, I rate books by how I feel while reading them, so my ratings are normally always subjective. In this case, I felt I had to give this book 5 stars based on the fantastic writing and the amazingly rich and unique backdrop of the train circus! It is obvious that the author did her research on circus culture and depression-era American history. She really dug into the down and dirty details of circus life. In the discussion after the last chapter you learn that many things in the story are based on true stories or anecdotes of the circus. The Bezini Brothers train circus is easily like another character in the book, flawed and deeply layered, like the characters themselves. I really liked how the story is told from Jacob's perspective as a spunky 93 year old man, having flashbacks of his life 70 year earlier. The altering perspectives (from young to old) effectively grounded the story and added another layer to his character.At times, this wasn't easy to read... It was sad to read about the indignities of being old, and I felt like Gruen's depiction was honest and very real. Though most of all, I had a really hard time reading some of the scenes with the animals. At one point I caught myself reading between my fingers, as if I was trying to block the scene from view as if it was a movie. I tried skipping over one but I had to go back and read it because I felt like it was important to the development of the characters and the story. It was, and they were.

I love when a book does that, and makes me both happy and sad, and this book does both of these things at various points.

He's not really sure.\"When you're five, you know your age down to the month. Even in your twenties you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three, you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties something strange starts to happen. It's a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation. How old are you? Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop. You were going to say thirty-three, but you're not. You're thirty-five. And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end. It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it.\"Jacob lives in a nursing home--a bit of a grumpy old man but he does OK overall. He likes to give the nurses a hard time every so often. He resents having to eat Jell-O and the other soft food they try to pass off in the dining room. But his mind is drifting a bit; sometimes he finds himself in vivid dreams--and wakes to find himself unsure of where he is and why he is there. And when a circus sets up shop near the nursing home, Jacob's mind begins to wander more--back to when he was a young man of twenty-three. Back when he knew exactly how old he was. Back when his life lay before him like a blank canvas.He was studying to be a veterinarian. Unbeknownst to Jacob, his parents had mortgaged themselves to the hilt to put him through vet school. The idea was for Jacob to return home and join his father in the family practice--E. Janokowski and Son, Doctors of Veterinary Medicine. But on the brink of graduation, Jacob is called out of class. His parents have been killed in a car accident.  He's alone in the world. He returns home to bury his parents and finds that his legacy--the vet practice--is gone. It is the Great Depression and like others, his parents had fallen on hard times and there is nothing left--the bank claims it all.Although Jacob returns to school to sit for his final exam, he walks out without completing it, follows a road down to the train tracks, and hops onto a passing train--a n action that changes everything. For this isn't an ordinary train--it is the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob has landed on a circus train.A less profitable and more shady circus than Ringling, the Benzini Brothers circus is its own society--populated by two basic social castes: the Performers and the Working Men. They live their lives on the circus train--crisscrossing the country and setting up in various small towns around America. With his veterinary background, Jacob soon finds himself in charge of the menagerie--the collection of animals that perform in the circus. From horses to tigers to monkeys, Jacob cares for the animals with compassion and concern--doing the best he can in difficult circumstances. (After all, when even the men don't get paid some days, there isn't much money for animal food.)He is befriended by a married couple who perform in the circus. Marlena is the beautiful star who performs with the Liberty Horses. August--Marlena's tempermental husband--is the equestrian director and superintendent of animals (in other words, Jacob's boss). Jacob is instantly smitten with Marlena but works hard to conceal his feelings--August has a dark temper that can flare unexpectedly. At first Jacob can control his attraction, but when the circus takes on Rosie--an elephant--things become complicated.The fates of Jacob, Rosie, Marlena and August become forever intertwined--linked together by love, hate, jealousy and violence. How this story plays out forms the core of the book--taking a path that is full of twists, turns and surprises.My ThoughtsSara Gruen does a brilliant job of creating a world that I've never read about before--the world of a traveling circus train in Depression-era America. What a colorful and fascinating setting this was. Gruen does a wonderful job of giving you the feel for a life of a circus worker, and the story is enhanced by the black-and-white photos of actual circus performers from the era. You feel like you're looking at photos of the actual characters that populate the book. In the Author's Note and the accompanying interview, Ms. Gruen talks about her inspiration and research for the book. There are a million little details that give this book such an authentic feel. She really did her homework and it shows. From the words used by the characters to the descriptions of the logistics of the circus to the types of men and women who made their home in what was essentially a traveling, self-contained community, I felt like I was really there on the circus train.Although the heart of the book is what happens to Jacob when he joins the circus, the book alternates between the elderly Jacob in the nursing home and young Jacob in the circus. I thought this juxtasposition worked well (except for the very end--I personally didn't care for the final choice that Gruen made for the elderly Jacob). When the circus comes to town and triggers Jacob's memories, his story unfolds in a natural way--with the reader getting more and more drawn in to Jacob's story as it unfolds in the book and in his memories.In addition, Gruen establishes a framing device in the prologue that influences the reader from the very start of the novel. I found this particular choice extremely effective--and I loved how she pulled it off and tied it together at the end. I love when an author plays with her readers a little bit, and Gruen did a great job in this aspect.If you're looking for a movie to go with the book, I must recommend Dumbo. I kept picturing scenes from that movie as I read the book, and I could completely imagine this story being told in a similar way.My Final RecommendationI definitely see why this book was a bestseller. It offers something for everyone--a unique setting, a bit of history, a romantic triangle, animals, an examination in what it means to grow old. This book effortlessly fits all of this in without seeming forced or strained. And on top of that, it is just a good story that makes you want to find out what happens next. If you haven't read it already, I think it is definitely worth a read. If I was attending the Benzini Brothers circus, I would be standing up and yelling \"Encore! Encore!\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Unique Setting + Good Writing = Fascinating Tale of Depression-Era Circus Train Life", "unixReviewTime": 1254096000, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2009"}

The chapters then alternate between old Jacob and his very depressed state at the Assisted Living Facility and him remembering his journey with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. The circumstances on how he came to join the circus as the show Veterinarian were very sad. He went from being a young man about to graduate from Cornell, his whole future ahead of him and the possibility of FINALLY losing his virginity, to having no one and nowhere to go.Once on the show, he meets August, the show's equestrian director and superintendent of animals. August is one very questionable character. He can be the most charming man around and moments later he can turn into the most terrifying creature you've ever encountered. He also meets Marlena, August's wife, and falls in love with her on the spot. At a later point, the show aquires an elephant named Rosie who is thought to be stupid because she won't learn to do anything the trainers try to make her do. Rosie plays a huge part in this story, and she gave me the biggest surprise in this book. This story also takes you on an eye opening journey through the sad conditions circus employees and animals were under in 1931.Water for Elephants was a completely different read for me. It was Adult, and it was realistic, and I loved it. I was a little skeptical about the circus theme. Can't say I've ever been curious enough about its workings to read a book revolving around one, but I am so glad I did because it was sooo much more than that! It made me laugh, cry and gasp in astonishment sometimes. It was a huge plus knowing this will be a movie (coming out in April) starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon as the main characters.

The animals are mistreated, the workers are mistreated, and the \"ring leader\" Uncle Al, is an egotistical, greedy SOB that you will love to hate.

Jacob Jankowski tells his story both in the form of memories while in a nursing home, and as the real time experiences of a 23-year old failed veterinary student in the midst of the Depression. Failing his exams, Jacob flees home and hooks up with a circus; he survives in this brutal world only because he has some skill with animals. Gruen paints a marvelous, completely believable portrait of a circus of the thirties, where the ruthless Uncle Al rules with the power of life and death. He deviates from planned appearances only to pick up the pieces of other failed circuses. Once someone ceases to be of use to the show, or if the money doesn't roll in as planned, they're gone--sometimes forever. It's a harsh world, but apparently historically accurate. And the old black and white photos at the beginning of each chapter are fascinating! Gruen's meticulous research makes the book--the plot line is a bit predictable and the ending a fantasy.

It's easy to see why this book is so popular.  That said; there are a few short comings, some minor, some more substantial.The research about depression era circus' (not that I profess to be an expert) is excellent and makes a fascinating backdrop to the story.  While the author makes great use of her research, the tone of the novel, particularly the dialogue, is too contemporary to sound authentic.  While this is a fault to some extent, it isn't one that will bother most readers.  In fact, it makes the novel more readable,likely contributing to it's success.  Fans of Faulkner and Steinbeck, of course, may beg to differ.I'm not sure why the author chose to make the novel's principal villain Jewish and allegedly Paranoid Schizophrenic.  The fact that he is Jewish is irrelevant to the plot (aside from the fact that it apparently makes his wife's family more likely to disown her) and his behaviour, while deplorable at times, isn't consistent with Schizophrenia at all.  These may seem like minor points, but they bothered me a little because they play into stereo types and were completely unnecessary.The romance that develops between Jacob and Marlena is predictable and uninspired.  The murder during the stampede is a little too contrived and highly improbable, and the final chapter is a little too sentimental for my tastes.  But despite these grievances, I was won over.The first half of the novel is definitely stronger than the second half.  Gruen's writing style is accessible, entertaining, and often very funny.  Jacob as an old man is cantankerous and vulnerable, and his frustration with growing old is truly heartbreaking.  These `present day' chapters are arguably the strongest in the novel.  While the love story is admittedly unremarkable, it was fascinating to read about life in the circus.  Greun weaves a series of amusing and presumably real (at least according to circus lore) anacdotes into the story.All in all, it isn't hard to see why this novel is a bestseller.  True, the love story is a little flat, but overall, the novel is hard not to like.  Water for Elephants isn't a literary masterpiece, but it's enormously entertaining.

There was no reason why at some point it switched back in time and then for no reason whatsoever it switched to real time.

People may get older, but their basic personalities stay the same, and these two Jacobs were totally dissimilar.  And, the author spent too much time in letting us know the horrid aspects of old folks in an old folks home and left us with none of the joys of companionship and the other qualities that people can enjoy in assisted living.

You feel the exitement, smell the animals, hear the band music, envision the clowns, hear the roar of the cats and feel the thumder under your feet as the elephants begin their parade... and the laughter and applause of the crowds.Jacob's life is not easy but it is intriguingly exciting and different. IF only he had taken the last test for his vet license...if only his parents had not died at that critical moment in his life...if only...if only...I loved this novel because it drew on every one of my emotions and satisfied my hunger for a really good story.

Persky", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Here is a delicious journey back to a gritty bygone era of big tops, roustabouts, circus trains, freak shows, midways.  Many of the extraordinary incidents in this novel, according to the author's notes, are rooted in oral history or based on anecdotes or actual written reports of those early 20th century years.  Those who rode the circus rails, many being family castaways and society's rejects, found family and home in that unique traveling milieu of humanity and managerie, and, in the process, grew tough in body and spirit.  BUT, even if you don't give a hoot about circuses or circus people, don't be put off by the title or theme.  (Although, is there really anyone in their 30s plus years who did not, as a child, sit and watch wide-eyed, delighting in the cheap glitz, the pulsating music, the flamboyant and rhinestone-studded costumes and, yes, the size and smell of the elephants, when the circus came to town?) This story is nostalgic in its telling, engaging in its characters, with a plot that clearly aligns the good guys against the bad.  There are wonderful descriptions of authentic circus activity, on-site intrigue, and a romance that you will really care about.  All of this, tucked into the ruminations of a contentious 90-year-old \"assisted-living\" resident whom you will also really care about.I suspect, however, one would have to have a soft spot for animals to want to open this novel and then to inhale it, as I did, in just a day and a half.

Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a \"90 or 93 year old man\" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works.

Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, \"my daughter and I loved this book\") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter \"will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter..\"But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.'

Second, Ms Gruen is writing the story from a male perspective, but she needs a little more practice.  Jacob seemed like a mama's boy, but I don't think that was her intention, instead it was her inability to really connect to her male character.Despite these minor flaws I found the story engrossing and from my male perspective I didn't think it ever got into 'romance novel' territory.  So guys, it's safe to read.  The trains, boozin' and rough living of a traveling circus in 1931 was very interesting.

I normally don't care for the sentimentality inherent in an old narrator looking back on his young days, but I found Water for Elephants didn't use cheap tricks to manipulate the reader's feelings. Instead it had a slow build and satisfying finish - marks of a novel well written. As the old man (Jacob) tells his story, I began to feel all the emotions that he did. By the end, I was fully invested.Gruen brings to life - the Depression era geeks and freaks of the circus with generous but not overdone descriptions.

I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book.  Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here.  The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider.  We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains.  Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and \"Uncle Al\", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page.  For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish.  I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater.  He's simply too many things rolled into one.  Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable.  And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic.  Perhaps if she'd actually used the \"show, don't tell\" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional.  As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man.  One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do.  Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook.  It's hard to respect a character like that.  Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram.  In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action.  I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where  a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story.  Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book three stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man.  I also really got a kick out of the ending.

I was expecting to be \"moved\"--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only \"moved\" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read \"uh\" or \"um\" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old.

At times the plot ran so quickly I found myself trying to search for a way to slow down the course of the story, but to no avail. The quick pace, however, does seem to fit and reaches a broader audience that seems to want rapid conclusion and catharsis. Reversions to the present time are a nice break from circus life and I believe are Gruen's most vivid and compelling depictions of the novel. Her illustration of life at the nursing home and perspective of the `patients' which Jacob catches a nurse stating when the correct political term is `residents' provides an accurate and refreshing look at assisted elderly homes. The circus lifestyle is portrayed truthfully, but is often overshadowed by the dynamics and major plot-line concerned with the Romantic relationship and triangle of Jacob, August, and Marlena.Gruen's, \"Water for Elephants\", is an easy read with relatively simple themes and motifs to comprehend including: animal cruelty, abusive relationships, circus life in the 30's, life during the Great Depression, coming of age, and older age/aging. It truly encapsulates a broad range of topics, but the overlaying plot and issues are prevalent and riveting, if a bit rushed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Circus Life Revistited in Gruen's Popular Title", "unixReviewTime": 1323648000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2011"}

Some were illuminating, some were disturbing, some made me think about some of my most deeply held beliefs.  All in all - I am very glad I read these books, but as I started into \"Water for Elephants\", I realized that it had been quite a while since I read a book mainly to find out what happens at the end.My dad recommended this book - and I'm glad he did.  It's a wonderful story.  We experience, along with the main character Jacob, two parts of his life.  We travel through the Great Depression with him after he runs away and joins the circus (!) and we also see his current life as a patient/resident of an assisted living center.  Both times of his life were interesting to me.  I know next to nothing about circuses - yet I could almost smell the sawdust and hear the music as I made my way through this tale.Gruen has filled her story with the colorful characters one would expect from a circus troupe.  Beautiful acrobats, tortured clowns, animals with personalities almost as big as their trainers (and sometimes bigger!).  The details are excellently woven in, letting the reader see just enough without blocking one's imagination.  As the story builds towards the climax - I found myself doubting the ending I had been sure would take place.  Gruen creates just enough tension and suspense to keep the reader turning the pages at a brisk pace.I enjoyed, too, the scenes of Jacob in the present day.  All circus aspects aside, the book has some excellent insight into a man who feels as if he has outlived his life...without becoming a man who was finished with living.  His fears of losing his memories and mind, the despair he feels at the sameness of each day, and the appreciation he has for the few delights left in his day to day existence are beautifully crafted.  He may come across as a crotchety old man at times, but the reader, and a few characters whose eyes still see a man instead of an old man, know that not to be true.\"Water for Elephants\" was a very enjoyable story.

It's easy to become engrossed in the description of circus life during the Depression era. It kept me reading and kept me interested.However:1. There were so many characters that are suddenly mentioned, without any introduction. This happens especially when Jacob joins the circus. I almost gave up trying to sort out who all these people were and believe it or not, a lot of them weren't mentioned more than a few times. Still, it was jarring trying to figure out who was important and who wasn't.2. As soon as Jacob sees Marlena, the beautiful equestrian performer, we know that they are going to be romantically involved. But when their romance does take off, there's no real build up. I didn't find myself caring about their romance because it wasn't something they fought for: they just happened to fall into bed together one day. Woohoo.3. Jacob at 23 has these epiphanies once in awhile about how he loves and wants to protect the animals at the circus because his father would have wanted him to and blah blah blah. But he simply doesn't. I found it difficult to care about him when he doesn't do anything to protect the animals he claims to care for.Overall, I enjoyed this book.

As the book went on, I felt I was also living in this circus train and witnessing all the activities.My heart definitely melted when they acquired Rosie, the elephant and at the same time, I started loathing the character August for abusing the elephant so much. In addition to that, the performer Walter/Kinko also transformed into this loving person that looked out after others.About half way through the book, I think almost all readers wanted nothing more than Jacob and Marlena being together and the death of August and Uncle Al. One thing I do believe a good author offers is the connection between the readers and the characters and I definitely felt that engagement with some of them and my heart ached at times as the story continued.I am not sure if I am a big fan of the Old Jacob. Not that it is bad but I really just did not quite get why it was important to keep his voice in. I did not see how old Jacob has contributed to the book and I think it could do without.Overall, I enjoyed the book so much and I was very happy to have resumed and finished it.

This is one of those stories where you think you've figure out exactly how everything is going to go . . .

As he feels he's losing control of his life, his mind slips back to the past, and through these lapses we're told the story.I never knew anything about how circuses traveled about in the past, and hearing about the cutthroat America during the Great Depression certainly brought an overpowering feel of reality to the story. Jobs were few and far between, and those that had them did anything they could to keep them. Describing the desperate times, the hobo jungles, and the pay cuts served to present a great representation of the time period.I loved hearing about the different circus acts, though I know that was but a miniscule part of the story. The tiny facts and funniest little things kept my interest and had me smiling. This book is definitely dark and depressing at moments. At others, it is brilliantly bright and full of hope. Any novel that can pull off both sides of the spectrum nearly flawlessly is excellent in my book.I give Water for Elephants 5/5 stars.

Not one bit.Entertaining and engrossing from the very first chapter, I was taken away on this journey with the characters. Nothing short of fascinating, in ways I wouldn't have thought possible.  Part love story, part coming of age, this is at its roots, a story about life and the unexpected paths it may take. I really came to love the character of Jacob, and sympathize with his situation and his love for animals. It's been over a week since I've finished the novel, and I still think about the characters every day.  I really got caught up in their world which is something, I must say, is sometimes way too rare in the books I read.

I listened to this as an audio book and it was very well done; they have two readers one for Jacob in his twenties and one for Jacob in his nineties.  It was a good read and I enjoyed learning about the circus.Jacob is ninety three and living in a retirement home, through his dreams and daydreams he relives a tumultuous time in his life in his twenties.  When Jacob is in his twenties he is getting ready to sit for his Veterinarian finals at Cornell University when he gets a call; his parents have been killed in a car accident.  Then when he gets home he finds out that the bank has seized his parents' house.  In a fit of grief and sorrow he abandons his exams and hops a train that just happens to be part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Through a series of circumstances he ends up working for them as their vet; taking care of the exotic animals in their menagerie.  In the process of all of this he falls in love with a beautiful performer named Marlena who has a brutally viscous husband, who also happens to be Jacob's boss.There were a number of things I liked about this book.  The story moves quickly and has a sense of mystery and doom about it as Jacob falls deeper into the seedy goings on in the circus and deeper in love with Marlena.  It is very engaging.It is clever how you see into Jacob's life in the present while he is in a nursing home.  These portions of the story really tug at your heart and give insight into an old man struggling to retain his sense of self in an environment where everything is sanitized and ordered.  These glimpses are bittersweet in contrast to the crazy life Jacob lived; obviously this man has lived and lived well and it is heartbreaking to watch him struggle with the descent into age that we are all faced with.The majority of the story is about Jacob's life in the circus.  Gruen doesn't shy away from the nitty gritty including sex, violence, language; as such this is definitely an adult read.  Issues such as animal cruelty, squalid living conditions for workers, and the Depression are woven throughout.  Making the story very believable and easy to relate to.All of the characters in this book are very human and engaging and have a lot of depth. Even the villainous characters (Al and August) have moments of graciousness and goodness.  While the main \"good\" characters do things that border on bad, if only through neglect.The only thing that really bothered me with this book is that I thought Jacob made too many bad decisions and too many mistakes.  I understood that he was young and hot-headed, but at the same time he is supposed to be very smart...and well...let's just say he doesn't spend much time thinking about his actions.  A lot of what happened he brought on himself and I think that this was inconsistent with the way he was presented as an upstanding citizen and character.The book ends well and should leave readers happy and smiling.  The story is expertly told and the look into the way a circus runs fascinating.  It would have been nice to have an afterward of Gruen talking about how accurately she represented the circus in this book.  Were all circuses like this?  Or was this one particularly bad?Overall this was a very engaging story, I enjoyed it a lot, and am happy that I read it.  The characters are fascinating, the glimpses into both life in the circus and life in a nursing home intriguing as well.  I loved how the book was set up with us seeing the elder Jacob's memories/story through his eyes.

She came to Fort Collins because her German Shephard needed open heart surgery, and while she was in town, she held a discussion/book signing at a local bookstore. Something she said struck me as rather odd. She said that she wanted the old circus photographs included in her novel because she didn't feel her readers would believe what she had written without the pictures. I'm not sure why she would feel this way, because as many reviewers have noted, her descriptions of the circus where the strongest parts of this novel.This was a book that I wanted to like better, but after all was said and done, it didn't leave much of an impression, other than her extensive research. The story, particularly the love story, was cliched, and the entire plot is predictable. Additionally, some parts of the story don't seem plausible. *SPOILER* For example, why would Jacob walk away from an Ivy League degree, needing only to complete a final exam? Yes, his parents were killed, but he knows that they made great sacrifices for him to attend Cornell. And what are the odds that when he jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night, it just happens to be a circus train?In addition to the predictable plot, it was hard to relate to any of thecliched characters. I think it says a lot when the most interesting character in the book is Rosie the elephant. Jacob displays little or no character growth. And the book has a typical \"Hollywood\" ending where the good guys get everything they want, even though they've had to sacrifice virtually nothing.

It vibrantly and realistically describes life in the travelling circuses of the era, including the freaks and other performers, the pecking order between management, performers and workers, life on the train, stops for shows in the small communities, and vivid descriptions of the performances.3.  The characters have depth and breadth, and touch you with their humanity (which is sometimes kind and more often than not, evil--as humans can be).4.

The contrast between the innocent young Jacob's foray into the rough-and-tumble world of a traveling circus and the old Jacob's cynical ruminations on life in a nursing home creates a \"book end\" effect that makes his story feel more real and meaningful.Gruen has also infused her novel with enough historical details to bring the sights, sounds and smells of the midway, menagerie and big top to life, without cramming in superfluous details that could have dragged on the story line.  The dialogue is sublime, especially the banter between the working men who handle the behind-the-scenes grunt work.

I was fascinated by this carefully researched, well-written look at the circus as a community with its own cultural norms, traditions, pecking order, and social bonds.A little-bit love story, a little-bit adventure,the underlying message is that individuals can overcome adversity if they are brave enough, or desperate enough, to take their lives into their own hands.This is the story of Jacob Jankowski, a Cornell vet student who loses everything in the Great Depression; parents, home, incipient career. Almost by accident he becomes a circus veterinarian. After a long and successful life, the elderly Jankowski escapes from a nursing home to once again join the Big Top.The author agiley shifts between Jacob's memories of circus life and his life in the nursing home. As Jacob's memories and present-day realities merge, the line between truth and fiction blurs. Perhaps Mr. Jankowski really did toddle off in his walker to be reabsorbed into the circus world; perhaps he died dreaming in his wheelchair.This is a lovely book; well-worth reading if you are interested in early twentieth-century history and/or the aging process.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Water for Elephants", "unixReviewTime": 1322092800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2011"}

It is written with such elegance and grace, that each voice is like a piece of silk weaving in and out like a slice of humanity screaming to be heard.Jacob Jankouwski tells this unbelievable tale from a rest home at ninety or is it 93? And his memories are so lush and tragic that the reader will be transformed into his past along with him.Jacob enters the `circus life' by no desire of his own, but this world changes him beyond belief.  The reader will be changed, too, and utterly awakened by this world within a world.  The caste system at The Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth reminded me of working on the cruise ships----the engineers, waiters, and third country employees working below the ship (boiler room) and the showgirls, casino staff, and shop girls working and living above the ship--as if they were superior in some respect.Rosie, the elephant, becomes the voice for all animals, whom deserve respect and caring for.  She also becomes the voice for old folks, such as Jacob, who for some reason are tossed to the side because of old bones, old minds, and loss of memory.Oh, but Rosie has not lost her memory as the reader will see.  And the abusers will pay for their sins as we all do.Sara Gruen has created brilliant, memorable characters, people whom I fell in love with and cared deeply about.  For example, Walter, the dwarf, who was so hard and incredulous on the outside, but had a dog he adored like his own baby.  The characters are articulately developed, and one will even feel empathy for the hateful August.\"Water for Elephants\" is a book about humanity:  how it can be dark and light at the same time, how people can change, how others do not, how survival is connected to love, and above all, how giving water to elephants is like giving water to the world.I dreaded turning the last page, exiting the circus and all of its peculiarities and delights.

There are so many great things about this book, when you put it all together, it was just one of the best books I've ever read.The point of view for Water for Elephants is unique. Jacob, the main character, comes to us first as a 90 (or is it 93?) year old man who is living in a seniors home. Most of the story is Jacob recalling his life with the circus, with short trips back to his here-and-now. I felt that I came to know all of Jacob. From his beginning, losing his parents in an accident, to his experience with the circus and his true love, to his last days feeling trapped in a body and mind that he wasn't free to control himself any longer.With the story being set in the 1930's and in the Depression, the book was even more interesting to read about days in that era.

Obviously traveling with the circus is going to make for some really interesting stories.There are many details throughout the book that I didn't think were nearly as bad as others have made them out to be in these other reviews on Amazon.-The sexual content really wasn't that explicit.  There were maybe two sex scenes and they really weren't that bad.  If you want explicit sex in the middle of a fiction story (without being considered erotic fiction) read John Irving's \"The World According to Garp\" and/or \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" and/or \"The Fourth Hand\" and/or \"The 158-Pound Marriage\".  All very good books that have way more detailed sex scenes that may or may not make you squeamish.  \"Water for Elephants\" barely grazed the surface of reproductive organs and whatnot.  So, if you're worried about that, don't be.-The animal cruelty also was not that bad.  Yes, it is written that someone would walk off and you could hear the animal cry out, but... other than that- it wasn't detracting from the entire story.  And not only that, but, I'm sure things like that really happen on the road.  There are definitely people who are capable of doing such things.  If you watch any show on \"Animal Planet\" or watch any real animal documentaries on late night television, you'll see that things are much worse.  So, if you're leery of the cruelty content, don't be.  It is also grazed over.There are many real elements- as far as I can tell- and whether or not the research was done before writing the novel, I think the descriptions are pretty believable.The only characters that really stood out were Walter and (in the beginning) Camel.  Jacob was a very strong narrator, but I didn't care for his burst of love for Marlena (a married performer).The back story behind Marlena and August's marriage was important, but it was summed up in about two paragraphs.The story behind Uncle Al's creation of the circus was interesting, but we barely meet Uncle Al.  And both August and Uncle Al seem to be bi-polar, which was annoying and unnecessary.  It is okay for there to be \"normal\" performers.  I don't think it was needed to move the story along or to qualify their actions.Most of the characters are added as bodies, but none have interesting or \"deep\" back stories.  To make it easier to remember their names and who they are (as the names are mentioned often), it would have been better for me to know more about these guys so that they really stick out in my mind as real people.There was nothing memorable about Camel by the end either- he lost his appeal about halfway through the book.Walter was interesting and probably my favorite character.Marlena was a bother.  I didn't get the whole tragedy of her marriage to August and felt that his temper was added in as only an excuse to make her want to be with Jacob.  The tangled love story wasn't even as interesting (to me) as the whole circus thing:  Redlighting and setting up the stage, and canceled wages, and the whole life of a circus performer.By the middle of the book, people started to become \"missing\" and/or dead, but I didn't care about those characters anyway- so, it seemed like those events were added just to make \"Water for Elephants\" interesting as a whole.This is my first Sara Gruen book, but it felt like \"Water for Elephants\" was a first novel for her too- though it was written well, the plot kind of fell flat by the middle of the story.  It was entertaining enough to finish, but I probably won't be recommending it.  I may try her again, in the future, but...

The pathetic circus Jacob joined was full of lively characters, some kindly, others cruel, and Jacob was forced to grow from naive youth to courageous man.  There were many pages that reduced me to sobs, especially those detailing the agonizing despair of some nursing home residents and some instances of animal cruelty at the circus.I would have given this book five stars, but I didn't like that it was written in the first person (which immediately takes away some suspense as to the future of the narrator), and it was written entirely in the present tense which struck me as awkward.

Jacob is your typical old man. He's seen too much in his life to give a crap what people say and think. From the first line Jacob spoke, I knew I loved him. He was sarcastic and funny, but also sad and lonely. His wife died a few years before, and his children and grandchildren only visit him in the nursing home for a few hours on Sunday. All Jacob has left are his memories of working for a circus when he was 23 years old (Rob Pattinson played young Jacob in the movie and it was wonderful having to picture him as Jacob. It was a beautiful sight!).At 23, Jacob is about to graduate veterinary school and go on to work for his father caring for animals. When his parents die in a car accident, he learns that his parents left him with no money and the bank repossessed their home (it takes place during the depression, and the Jankowski's were struggling along with everyone else). Jacob, having no where to turn, jumps unto a moving train and in this moment his life will change forever.Water for Elephants has an amazing cast of characters that all bring something to the story. Jacob meets the beautiful, Marlena, her charming, but sadistic husband, August, as well as many others that all shape Jacob's life one way or another. Even the animals play a huge role in his life!I think my favorite part of this story was the last few pages. Not because it was over, but everything came together so beautifully.

Not every page was perfection I will admit but my annoyance was due to my own impatience about wanting to get back to a certain character rather than learning a bit more about another.It is quite clear from the moment you begin that the author did some seriously extensive research about the Depression era in general and circus life specifically.The way the author weaves the story between present day and older Jacob (at 90 or 93, he can't quite remember) and the flashbacks to the past (when Jacob was in his 20's) are fantastic.

The photographs are intensely interesting, revealing the grime, brutality and absurdity underneath the surface glamour of the traveling circuses of that era.Gruen was inspired by the photographs to write this novel.  Gruen thoroughly researched her subject matter, collecting scores of anecdotes that revealed the brutality and desperation of that world.  She weaved the anecdotes together with a love story worthy of a three-hanky weepie from the 1930s. The combination of grit and sweetness works only to a point, but the inherently interesting nature of the subject matter managed to hold my interest to the end.To me, however, Gruen never managed to transcend her source material.  The primary problem was the narrator's voice.  Although the book was sprinkled with circus-specific vocabularly of that era, Gruen utterly fails to capture the rhythm or syntax of the time or milieu. Gruen's language felt inappropriately contemporary, which undermined the overall credibility of the story.  The subject matter cried out for a writer with an ear for the street; I kept thinking about what Damon Runyon or Ring Lardner could have done with this material.The other major problem was that Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story.  Gruen could have honored the animals' intelligence -- and decried the brutality of their treatment -- without veering into fantasy.In the end, while I wasn't sorry I read the book, I would have preferred to read a non-fiction account of life in the Depression-era circus from a first hand source rather than this watered down trifle.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Doesn't Transcend The Source Material", "unixReviewTime": 1162684800, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2006"}

It is rare for me to find a book that is so entertaining but this one was.  I have never read any of the other books by this author, but she is excellent.  The book takes you into the time of the depression and you feel, smell and experience everything that the charachter is feeling.  The main charachter is in his nineties now, but we get to travel back in time through him, to this time in U.S. history and experience how a traveling circus worked back then.  It is such a richly written story, you will not want to put it down.  The desperation of the times, the way people lived, their expectations, their feelings, etc. are all here.  I have recommended this book to multiple friends, which I rarely do.  You will not be disappointed with this story.  There are no low points that drag.  It's a green light read from start to finish.

I put this aside for awhile, trying to avoid all of the hype this book has received, but I am definitely glad I finally picked it up.Told from the point of view of his 93-year old self as he relives his life through his dreams, Jacob, a then-student about to finish gain his veterinary degree at the prestigious ivy league, Cornell, is abruptly summoned home to identify the bodies of his parents, who have tragically died in a car accident.  Left with no money, no practice, and no home, he starts to walk, unsure of where his once bright future now lies.  He stumbles upon the train of the Benzini Brothers circus.  The show's ringmaster, Uncle Al, whose ultimate goal is to \"one-up\" the more prominent Ringling circus, takes Jacob on as a vet to the animals in the show (because of course, if Ringling has a vet, he needs one too).Life on a circus train, however isn't all it's cracked up to be, and the circus and country has fallen on hard times & the working men find that more and more of their co-workers have been redlighted (tossed off the train in the dead of night) in order to cut costs.  With being redlighted as a real possibility, workers have to do their part to earn their place on the train and work hard not to make the wrong people angry, often without pay.As Jacob adjusts to life as part of a circus, he finds foes, friends who become family, and of course the love interests of the married star of the show! A tangled mess of jealous, mental illnesses, and the struggle to simply survive unfolds as the memories of his life come back to the 93-year old man in the nursing home.Definitely one of the best books I've read of all time, with 100% ability to become one of the classics that children will one day read in their English classes.  If you're looking for a book to transport you back in time, with the excitement that life on a circus trail brings, this is definitely a book for you to pick up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An modern classic", "unixReviewTime": 1311811200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2011"}

I wanted to love it, I really did, but something just fell flat. The story was good, although I found the flashing back and forth distracting, and Sara Gruen obviously did copious amounts of research, but I just couldn't get excited about it.The character of Marlena could have been a really interesting and multi-layered person, but instead she is really only presented as a delicate flower who loves animals, married a psychopath, and sometimes displays teenage acts of defiance. Why did Jacob love her so much? There must have been more to her than that, but the reader is never let in on that secret. It's even more odd because the author is a woman. They had strong female personalities in the 1930s, I'm sure of it.As for Jacob, I thought that he displayed a lot of the conflict and inner questioning that you like to see in a lead character and his development as he gets to know the people that work for the circus was enjoyable. His relationship with the animals was obviously meant to heal him after the death of his parents, but again, I felt like that connection was rushed and then brushed aside. His relationship with Rosie, the gentle and abused Polish speaking (well, Polish understanding) elephant, was an excellent metaphor for his own gentle nature and his inability to stand up for himself and break free. Of course, in the end, everyone is free thanks to Rosie and we get the happy ending.I did not hate the book at all, but I wanted more from it. I think if the author had been allowed to write about 100 pages more, it could have been a great novel instead of just ok.

The portrayal of old man Jacob by John Randolph Jones was spot on.  The enactment of the young Jacob by David LeDoux was good, but a little bit monotonous in tone.  He did do a good job on the other characters' voices, making them sound different from Jacob.  The book was well-written, with excellent characters who all had distinct personalities, and dialogue that rang true.  I bought the depression era plight of a young veterinary student doubly shocked at losing his parents and then their home.  This made a credible segue to his becoming the veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers circus.  Ms. Gruen does a believable portrayal of the Depression era, the working class, and the animals in the menagerie.  The story flows well, but is a bit melodramatic to my taste, in spots.  The love story between Jacob and Marlena works, but is a little long in development.  At first I did not see the relevance of the old Jacob interludes in the story, but they did lead to a sweet and appropriate ending to the book.I have one issue which maybe someone could answer.  I don't understand the relationship of the prologue to the rest of the book.  The text of the prologue duplicates the climactic event of the book itself, yet has a completely different outcome, and one that contradicts what happened \"in real life\".  I don't understand why there should be such a contradiction, and it wasn't explained by something like \"and then I woke up from the dream\".  Instead, the prologue merely ends with \"in 70 years I never told a single soul\" or something like this.  So why do we have a difference of fact between two parts of the book?

Now, Jacob could have gone back and finished the test.  However, he felt guilty once he learned that there were no money left from his parents because they spent all they had to finance Jacob's schooling.By some strange turns of events, Jacob found himself riding with a traveling circus, one that aimed to be better than the Ringling Bros.

The novel begins with main character Jacob Jankowski, a 93-year-old man in a nursing home, when the circus comes to town. This begins his flashback of his time with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931.While it focuses on the cirucs, the novel weaves back and forth between a 23-year-old Jacob on the circus and present-day Jacob with his nursing home struggles.Jacob had never intended to end up on the circus, but once he does he is caught in a whirlwind of romance and drama. He has to learn the ropes of a struggling circus that can't always afford to pay its employees. Each character has his/her own unique qualities that make each seem as real and relatable as the next. Even the circus's animals take on personalities that make them seem real.After the great reviews I wanted to give it a shot and I had trouble putting it down.

As it turns out, I just finished it and quite simply, it's fantastic. Set in both present time and the 1920's, it tells the tale of young Jacob Jankowski's circus days: how he stumbled upon the spectacle, how he made himself useful, and how he found true love. Told through flashbacks of himself at ninety...or ninety three, a fact he keeps forgetting, you see how the circus life effected him and what became of him after his years under the big top.After leaving Cornell, Jacob made his way onto the Benzini Brothers most Spectacular Show on Earth, a not as good as Ringling Brothers, but still decent traveling circus. He became the show's veterinarian, watching over the lions, chimps, horses, and, of course, elephant. There, he meets a dazzling array of characters including Walter, the show's midget clown; Earl, the strong man; Uncle Al, the show's ringmaster and owner; August, the moody and arrogant animal keeper; and his wife Marlena, the lovely horse tamer and elephant rider that Jacob falls for.Accompanied by archived photos from the Ringling Circus Museum, the book accurately portrays the life of a traveling circus member, riding the train daily going from city to city, hoping the town is looking for an afternoon of entertainment. In a time when entertainment was scarce, the circus really was a legendary spectacle. Money was tight and the sleeping quarters were tighter. The performers were treated like Gods, but the workers were seen as slaves. But when you were living cent by cent, it was a job--and a good job at that.As a reader, you're wrapped up my Jacob's tale, following him through his four month stay with the Benzini Brothers. You cheer him on and fear for his life all at the same time. You become attached, friends. And the ending leaves you satisfied, fulfilled and content.Personally, I was disappointed that they didn't concentrate more on the acts, however that's a small complaint from an otherwise fantastic read. Even for those who have no interest or knowledge of the circus lifestyle will get something out of it. Because at one time we've all seen the show. We've all seen the clowns, the elephants, and the acrobats. We've all eaten the pop corn and cotton candy sold from the striped tents.

He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money.  So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus.

August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal.  He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out.  Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all.  The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot.

The descriptions of the circus, the towns, and the train travel with all the animals seemed so authentic. However, I thought that canceling several shows and rushing west to buy an elephant and book someone for a sideshow seemed to be stretching things a bit. The expenses to feed all the animals and the employees would have been huge. I kept thinking this would have been handled by having either Big Al or one of his managers travel alone and make the transaction while the show went on back East. Other than that part, though, I was completely drawn in. I thought Jacob and Marlena made a wonderful couple. Marlena, by the time she met Jacob, already needed rescuing. And Jacob was a gentleman, who responded not only to her beauty and talent, but to her need for rescue. It's not surprising to me that they quickly fell for each other. My other favorite characters were Walter, a dwarf, and Rosie, the elephant.The circus part of the book was set in 1931, a time when people would take just about any job and put up with a lot of abuse to keep it if they had to. This helped to make some of the events more interesting and believable. The rest of the story is told by the 93-year-old Jacob and the author did a superb job of portraying the world from the point of view of someone who's in a care center and isn't always allowed to make his own choices.

Jacob Jankowski resides in an assisted living home with other elderly people, many of whom require more medical attention than he.  He is quite mentally astute for his age, yet because of his age, most of the people in charge of the facility treat him as mentally incompetent, all but Rosemary, a forty-seven-year-old nurse, who treats him and the rest of the patients/residents with the loving care, dignity, and respect they deserve as human beings.  But she is moving away and will be quitting the facility, which in the end leads to Jacob's decision to continue his life--what little he may have left--in dignity.There is a circus that has come to town.  It is so close to the facility that the big tent and other goings on can be observed from the window.  All of the old people reminisce about their experiences in their youth going to the circus.  One old man and a newcomer to the home, Mr. Joseph McGuinty, who is considerably younger than Jacob, brags about having worked in a circus, carrying \"water for elephants.\"  Jacob becomes upset because he knows Mr. McGuinty is lying to attract the attention of the other residents; and the memories of the truth of his past life are triggered.Flashback to young Jacob Jankowski, a veterinary student at Cornell University in his last year!  Just before he is scheduled to take his final exams, after which he will graduate and receive his degree, both his parents are killed in an automobile accident.  After their burial and after learning the truth of his financial situation, Jacob is unable to focus.  He leaves the exam room and leaves Cornell.  Distraught, he leaves with only the clothes on his back and no money in his pocket.Because of the Depression, people were unable to pay for his father's services; and his father, also a veterinarian, worked for people even though they could not pay him, taking whatever they could give him--eggs, chickens, whatever they had.  Therefore, his parents had nothing to leave their son but debts.  To pay his tuition, the house had been mortgaged.So not being able to focus, he leaves without ever putting pen to paper.  Without aim or destination, he walks and soon finds himself beside the railroad tracks, when along comes a train.  Like a hobo, he hops the train with no idea where he is going.  He soon learns this is a circus train and is not tossed off it because the Benzini Brothers, whose circus it is, discover he is a veterinarian; and his services are badly needed.Working as a veterinarian that summer leads to all kinds of experiences, tantamount among them which are falling in love, getting married, and eventually working with the circus's one elephant.After his summer with the Benzini Brothers, he is hired by Ringling Brothers.  He, along with his wife and his growing family, spends seven years as a circus veterinarian.  He then becomes the veterinarian for the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.  His seven years experience with exotic animals and his degree, in addition to bringing an elephant with him, insures him the job when the former vet suddenly dies.Jacob, ninety years old--or is he 93? he asks himself, recognizing that his old age has caused some memory loss--struggles to hold onto his humanity and his dignity as long as he can.  It is he who in his reminiscences about his circus life, his friendships, and his deep love for his wife narrates the story.  The reader falls in love with Jacob and develops an even greater love and respect for \"old folks.\"  Sara Gruen's novel awakens the reader to the often mistreatment of and disrespect for the elderly, evoking empathy in their cause.  Especially hurtful is seeing how their own families, their own children, mistreat them, or forget about them.  Old people are still human beings.  In many cases, their bodies may be broken, their hands and fingers gnarled, but in all cases, there is a brain inside their heads as Jacob proves.  In having Jacob tell his story in Water for Elephants, the author informs us of this and reminds us of the fact that we will grow old someday.  At the same time Sara Gruen affords us a moving and delightful read--so do not be misled by the title.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Respect for the Elderly", "unixReviewTime": 1213660800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2008"}

There are over 2,600 reviews already and I doubt I'll be able to add anything new or groundbreaking.  My mom and my friend have been trying to get me to read Water For Elephants for the past couple of years, but I've resisted.  I didn't want to read this book for a few reasons, namely - the subject matter (a traveling circus) didn't really excite me, the idea of an old man telling the story in a sort of flashback manner reminded me too much of The Notebook (of which I only saw the movie), and most of all, I didn't want to read this story because I absolutely adore animals and I knew there would be parts about abuse that would be difficult for me to read.  But now that the movie has come out, I knew it was time to give it a go.  Books are always so much better than movies and I wanted to check this novel off my list before it possibly became tainted by Robert Pattinson's portrayal.... just in case.  :)If, like me, you also have these reservations - don't let them stop you.  Yes, the story is rather sad in parts, and it will make your heart break, but it's so much more.  It took me a while to really get in to the story, but I absolutely tore through the last 200 or so pages.  It's not so much a love story as it is a life story.You can really tell that the author did her homework.  There are vivid, graphic descriptions of everything and you feel like you're right there with these characters.  The true mark of a good writer (at least for me) is when they can create characters that you hate and abhor so much they can actually make your skin crawl even after you've read the last page.  This author did that - and with more than one character.Overall, it was a fantastic story and I highly recommend it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic!", "unixReviewTime": 1303948800, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2011"}

I kept thinking I was reading a screenplay (although this didn't bother me, I did note it).Cornell-educated Jacob Jankowski looks back upon and retells the story of what became his unlikely life as a Circus Veterinarian.

He almost accidentally falls into a job with a traveling circus. It's a rough and uncertain life, but he comes to love and care for the animals. On the other hand, he doesn't do so well with some of the people.

I wanted to be an acrobat at one point, swigging around high up in the sky. I don't think I ever really considered the repercussions of such a life though-always moving around, having to live with who you work with weather you like it or not, constant work...now it sounds more hard than fun to me.But Jacob Jankowski never really had a choice in the matter. Emotionally wrecked and financially bereft when his parents die in the great depression, Jacob hops on a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers most spectacular show on earth. With his status as a (not graduated but) Cornell trained Vet, Jacob is hired on to see to the shows animals.Its decent work, but hard. And Jacob's boss August only makes it harder with his mercurial temperament and his very beautiful wife, one of the circuses star performers-who might like Jacob a little too much. But it's an arrangement Joseph can live with-until Rosie comes along.Every circus needs an elephant right? And Rosie becomes Jacob's. As circus life becomes more and more perilous-Can Jacob get out with his friends, animals and possible love of his life alive and intact? Come to the show and find out?\"Water for Elephants\" is a fantastic little gem of a book. The writing is marvelous, engaging, funny, sad-it's perfect really, except for one thing. And how could one fail to read the book after reading the prolog?

Uncle Al, the unscrupulous and chiseling owner, runs a tight train.  He has thugs who throw non-productive and trouble-making employees off the train to their deaths in a practice known as \"red-lighting.\"  He also buys down-and-out circuses and, in one such act, acquires Rosie the Polish speaking elephant, who is smarter than anyone but Jacob knows.Jacob is the only person in the book who has a handle on a moral compass and as his reward he spends most of the novel beaten, broken, concussed, bleeding, swollen and hung over.  He is the self-appointed Protector of the Downtrodden who makes a dangerous mistake: he falls in love with Marlena, an animal act performer who is married to the brutal August, the menagerie supervisor.  His cruelty to animals and his violence are probably due to paranoid schizophrenia.  It is enough that he terrorizes everyone in his life and every animal, too.Jacob is forced to bunk in the horse car with the Shakespeare-reading Walter, aka \"Kinko,\" a dwarf who is devoted to the Jack Russell terrier that is part of his act.  As the train carries the circus across the US, the lives of the performers and workers intertwine, relationships and loyalties are tested, and Jacob becomes a hero through simple humanity to Camel, a drunken laborer who is poisoned by drinking Jamaica ginger.The best scene in the entire novel is the descriptive passage of Marlena performing with her horse team and with Rosie, the elephant in her pink sequined costume.

The authors love of animals and the tremendous research she did for this novel make it not only a fascinating portrayal of life, ugly and vibrant in the American circus of the 1930's but a beautiful and tender love story. I had never even heard of circus trains until I read this either and learning a little something when I read also appeals to me.The title had been on my wishlist for awhile so I was delighted to obtain a copy recently and wanted to get on with reading so that I can see the film, which has been recommended to me.Since seeing elephants up close in Thailand, I also have more understanding of just how intelligent they are. Wonderful creatures which will treat humans well if they are given the respect they deserve. Sara Gruen portrays the nature of the elephant perfectly, for me Rosie was the real protagonist of the novel. The novel is told as two separate but connected stories, as well as being immersed in the circus world, we are also given an inside view of a home for the elderly where the hero of the story Jacob is now living. Again the author has done her research as the scenes in the nursing home were poignant and all too familiar to me in many ways.When the novel starts Jacob Jankowski is in his nineties and living in a nursing home and the imminent arrival of the circus in town revives some very stirring memories for the old man and it is these that are told in the other storyline.It is the American Depression and when Jacob's parents die while he is studying veterinary science at university, he discovers that they were in dire financial difficulties and he cannot even afford to complete his studies. Confused and bewildered with no plans for his future he finds himself hitching a ride on a circus train and in that moment his whole life changes. By the following morning he finds himself working for the travelling circus and by that evening he has met and fallen for the woman who will for evermore be the love of his life. Marlena, the star performer, however the love should remain unrequited as she is married to August the strangely mad animal trainer. Of course it is not long either before he also meets my particular favourite, Rosie the elephant. Whilst struggling to survive in the world of this second rate travelling circus this young couples love overcomes obstacles that you can not begin to imagine.The two stories are ultimately woven together but to find out just how you will have to read for yourself.

Water for Elephants has been lauded as a \"great pick for summer\", but this book is so much more. It has a depth and a substance to it that you don't usually find in your typical \"beach read\". It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses).  According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers. As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.The main character is a cantankerous, still-sharp 93-year-old man, and his frustration at being trapped in an old man's body is palpable. The story of his incredible life and adventures with the Benzini Brothers circus unfolds in a way that is emotionally wrenching, and yet flashes of good humor pervade throughout. The characters are richly drawn, and even the animals are given complex personalities that make them a pivotal part of the story. There is something in the novel for everyone: it is equal parts adventure, mystery, fictional memoir, love story, and historical account.I highly recommend this book!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Looking for an entertaining read?

The second sees Jacob years later as a bored, temperamental old man in a nursing home. Having nothing but time, the older Jacob slips in and out of memories, mentally revisiting his days with the circus.The main focus of the \"circus\" storyline is the love triangle between Jacob, the circus's equestrian director, August, and August's beautiful wife Marlena, a performer. Although they all start out as friends, it soon proves to be a disjointed friendship at best. Despite his charming exterior, August is a two-dimensional bully prone to violent rages. Jacob, on the other hand, is relatively sane, competent though naive, and shares a mutual passion with Marlena (also somewhat two-dimensional) for the circus animals.The story has potential. Honestly, what's a more romantic setting for a love story than the surreal world of the circus?

But sadly, animal circuses haven't changed much since that time.  Human workers may no longer be \"redlighted\", but captive wild animals are still packed into buses or trains without heat in winter or air conditioning in summer, imprisoned in cages or chained up, forced to perform demeaning tricks for the public, and given generally substandard, if any, medical care and often, not enough nourishment.Gruen can tell a story, she has vivid characters, she presented the animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light, and I enjoyed the read.  But I have to say that to me, the happy ending of Jacob and Marlena finding employment with Ringling Brothers so they can bring Rosie, Bobo and the horses along with them is anything but.  Admittedly, for those times, it may have been the only option open to them, and there were few if any animal protection advocates out there exposing circuses like Ringling.  The truth is that Ringling Brothers has a long history of well-documented animal abuse, particularly of elephants, something Ms. Gruen never refers to in her novel--although, to her credit, she talks about the infamous, unbelievably cruel execution of Topsy by electrocution of none other than American paragon Thomas Edison.  It's also quite unrealistic that they would be able to keep an adult chimp as a pet, especially with five children of their own to care for and protect.  Chimps become quite intractable as adults; they're extremely strong, unpredictable and dangerous.I can't help thinking that the happy ending to a circus novel set in the 21st century would have Rosie sent to a place like The Elephant Sanctuary to spend her remaining life blissfully roaming hundreds of acres with other former circus and zoo elephants, and Bobo retiring to a wonderful sanctuary like Save the Chimps, where he would join a chimp family and have the closest thing to a normal life a captive ape can have.  And Jacob getting a job at a zoo so he can take Rosie along after his circus career is also not a very cheery outcome for me.  There's no question that zoo elephants lead short, painful, highly restricted lives, and many zoos are in the process of retiring their elephants to sanctuaries.Also, it's quite unbelievable to me that after Jacob witnessed so much brutality while working for circuses earlier in his life, he would want to join a circus again rather than live in a nursing home.  That speaks volumes about that nursing home!Lastly, I understand that the author considers herself an animal lover, but that can mean a lot of things, and I'm wondering exactly what her agenda was, writing this book.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Brutality of animal circuses hasn't changed much", "unixReviewTime": 1230249600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2008"}

Hopping a train that by chance belongs to The Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, Jacob hires on to care for the menagerie, his training an entre into this bizarre world; but as the novel begins, Jacob is an old man, restricted to an assisted living home, his memories sparked by a nearby visiting circus and a creeping helplessness that assaults his ageing body: \"Age is a terrible thief. Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, it knocks your legs out from under you and stoops your back.\"The story is related in the somber tones of the Depression, the hardscrabble and often unscrupulous business of a traveling circus and the heartless despots who make their fortunes on the backs of men who must do anything to survive. Star performer Marlena, an equestrian, is sensitive to the needs of her horses, although her mercurial husband, August, the trainer, is obsessively jealous and given to unspeakable cruelties. Uncle Al, Benzini Brothers circus owner-by-default, is a ruthless businessman who cares little for man or beast, engaged in a quest for fame to rival the great Ringling Brothers. With his advanced training in veterinary medicine, Jacob does his best to protect the animals from their harsh existence, especially Rosie, an elephant purchased to replace Marlena's lead horse. Jacob and Rosie share an affinity for one another, the huge creature at times almost human. Because of his growing affection for Marlena, Jacob suffers August's increasing affronts, caught in a cycle of inevitable violence, certain of a reckoning.In chapters that move flawlessly back and forth in time, from the rowdy circus atmosphere to the antiseptic corridors of the assisted living home, the world is viewed through Jacob's perspective, as he rages helplessly against the decrepitude of old age and the secrets of the past. In prose both poignant and infinitely tender, Jacob dwells in both worlds, revealing the wounds of the past and the sorrows of the present. In one touching scene, Jacob awaits a family member to escort him to the circus, yearning for the Big Top with every fiber of his being, craving the familiar sights and smells of that pivotal summer of `31, the roustabouts, the kinkers, the rubes, the animals. The denouement is devastating, as inescapable as the indifferent world that turns a blind eye to the vagrants of the 30's. Yet Jacob's spirit retains the essence of his kind nature and a respect for others, a man who will not be broken by circumstances. All is redeemed in a coup d'grace that will leave the reader strangely satisfied and richer for having met this raggedy tribe of miscreants and lost souls.

I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in a day. I was absolutely captivated. Each incident, each character, the plot, the time-frame - every aspect of this book was simply amazing and I was even brought to tears twice.What a perfect setting. The Great Depression - the time when the great circus shows began to lose their prowess as the best kind of entertainment. But the Benzini Brothers circus isn't the fun, song-and-dance circus that everyone thinks of from movies like 'The Greatest Show on Earth', 'Merry Andrew' or even Disney's 'Dumbo'. This circus is a delight on the surface, but a nasty, dirty, dangerous and deadly place to be if you're not a performer. (And even some of the performers get the boot - like poor Walter the dwarf clown.)This kind of circus gives a taste of what spectators and boys who dream of running away to join the circus would never imagine.The method of Jacob's memoirs - alternating between his life now at 93 years old - still sharp minded and still having all of his teeth, stuck in a nursing home and feeling horribly depressed about it all, and remembering what happened during his time with the Benzini Brothers Circus - is an incredible technique. One minute I was drawn in by his angst of losing his parents, his home and his security to the point of jumping the next train to anywhere, and then suddenly, we are back in the nursing home, and poor Jacob is fighting with a fellow resident about the possibility of carrying water for elephants.Add the vulturous Uncle Al, the wicked ringmaster who'll stop at nothing to make his circus better than the Ringling Bros., the schizophrenic August, beautiful Marlena, a half-paralyzed drunk, a cranky dwarf and his little dog, Queenie, and an elephant who only understands Polish. The characters alone are enough to make you want to read before you even know half of what is going on.As I said, twice I was brought to tears - once by old Jacob in the nursing home, when he realizes that his five children had forgotten who was to take him on his outing, and he was actually brought to tears himself. I just couldn't help but think of my own 90 year old grandfather, who isn't in assisted living and drives himself and my grandmother to Florida every winter and goes bowling and plays shuffleboard every week. It was sad to think of poor Jacob, excited about getting to see the circus one last time, and then being terribly disappointed that his own children had forgotten. It made me feel like I will never let that happen to my grandfather.No one who reads this book will be disappointed. From cover to cover, it is absolutely wonderful. The writing style is simple and easy to understand. There is no 'filler' - unnecessary, boring descriptions or dialogue that has nothing to do with the story. It is an excellent novel and although I could rave some more about my favorite characters and my favorites scenes and so on, I will simply say that it is a must-read.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Water for Elephants", "unixReviewTime": 1154736000, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2006"}
