Pham uses full-page, half-page, and spot art against a white background to illustrate this familial bond. Her pen, ink, and digital art is the star here. She is such a master at conveying a full range of facial expressions and delightful comic details in her lively sketches that much of her slight text is unnecessary. Mothers will enjoy reading this to their sons, but it is not likely to become a favorite with children. It would make a lovely gift for Mother's Day or for a new mother, but it is not a first purchase for children's collections.&#x2013;Rachel G. Payne, Brooklyn Public Library, NY. (c) Copyright 2010.

It&#x2019;s a priceless collection of anecdotes about the artists and writers reflecting and filtering the eras they worked in. The most timely strand threads through issues of creators&#x2019; rights and intellectual property, an argument that&#x2019;s heating up today&#x2019;s comics climate.

Excited, Nico agrees, but later begins to wonder, \"How will I be so kind?\" So begins a pleasant story about sharing everyday kindnesses. This book has a wealth of meaningful messages like, \"being kind is showing concern for others.\" Each message is illustrated by the actions of either Nico or Lola as they spend their time together doing doggy and boy activities. Each new page shows the duo participating in excellent behaviors: cleaning, helping one another, sharing, exercising, and getting along with others. The rural, verdant setting adds to the appeal of this story. The photos suffer from some poor composition and digital editing, but the adorable nature of the subjects more than makes up for this. A good choice for teaching core values, this book will have wide appeal for young audiences.Jasmine L.

{"asin": "0061990558", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Jurassic Parkauthor Michael Crichton is possibly the best science teacher for the masses sinceH.G. Wells, andSphere, his thriller about a mysterious spherical spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, is classic Crichton. A group of not-very-complex characters (portrayed in the film by Sharon Stone, Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Queen Latifah) assemble to solve a cleverly designed roller coaster of a mystery while attempting (with mixed success) to avoid sudden death and expounding (much more successfully) on the latest, coolest scientific ideas, including the existence of black holes. Somehow, Crichton manages to convey the complicated stuff in utterly simplistic prose, making him, as his old pal Steven Spielberg puts it, &quot;the high priest of high concept.&quot; Yet there is more to Crichton than science and big-ticket show biz. He is also, as any reader of his startling memoirTravelsknows, a bit of a mystic--he is entirely open to notions spouted by spoon-bending psychics that most science writers would scorn.Sphereis not only a gratifying sci-fi suspense tale; it also reflects Crichton's keen interest in the unexplained powers of the human mind. When something passes through a black hole in Crichton's fiction, a lesson is learned. The book also contains another profound lesson: when you're staring down a giant squid with an eyeball the size of a dinner plate, don't blink first.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Sphere", "price": 7.3, "salesRank": {"Books": 24616}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ajMdLlRVL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061782556", "006170315X", "0061703087", "0345526775", "0345538986", "0345468260", "0345538994", "0061782661", "0060873175", "0060873167", "0061782637", "0345539001", "0061929387", "0451210638", "009948241X", "1783291249", "006178267X", "0345538978", "0804171270", "1783291257", "0099233010", "0060873051", "1783291206", "0345370775", "0451155750", "034553901X", "0425240339", "0307743659", "0440245923", "042510107X", "0099319519", "B00BV2M9LO", "0804171297", "0061929409", "0060872985", "0486400603", "0394513924", "B0029O0BLS", "1783291230", "0671041789", "1783291192", "1783291184", "0425250369", "0062227211", "0425188809", "0553293397", "140272599X", "0804171289", "044661615X", "0062227203", "0671004107", "0441172717", "0671676253", "0345380371", "0345391802", "055338256X", "0345531930", "0061836958", "0066214122", "0451210840", "B0057DCQMK", "0061468428", "1490547800", "0345533321", "0743497465", "0425252256", "042526940X", "0345530578", "1940026016", "0441569595", "0060873035", "0451168615", "034539092X", "0312944926", "079073639X", "045123281X", "0553593064", "0394589424", "B0017IVHHO", "0345418778", "0425218929", "042510687X", "034553056X", "0553283685", "0345391837", "0345531973", "0307743675", "0812550706", "1783291222", "0553593072", "0440245117", "0446364193", "1400079152", "1476733953", "1476754454", "0553288105", "0312924585", "0553299492", "0345391829", "1451678193"], "bought_together": ["006170315X", "0345538986"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0345538986", "0345538994", "006170315X", "0061782556"]}}
{"asin": "006199099X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "For forty years, collector Rob Roth has gathered rare examples of rock tour posters, advertising posters, rock memorabilia, original artwork and items of merchandise. His spectacular collection is so vast that it has never all been put on public display, but when visitors to his spacious New York loft apartment&#8212;visitors like Elton John and Alice Cooper&#8212;caught a glimpse of some of the material Roth has collected over the years, they were amazed and urged him to let rock fans see the dazzling array of artifacts. When designer John Varvatos saw the collection, he was so stunned by it that he begged Roth to lend him pieces for his new store in Las Vegas. More of Roth's pieces will be on display in the Varvatos Soho store and other upcoming locations in the fall of 2010. Varvatos has even offered to host a launch party in the Soho store for the book at its time of publication.For many, the items lovingly cataloged in the pages ofThe Art of Classic Rockwill evoke nostalgic memories of their youth&#8212;of blazing lights, drifting smoke and of the all-pervading power of their favorite rock concerts. Unlike anything else on the market,The Art of Classic Rockis a lavishly produced presentation of the most vivid and exciting artwork from the rock world, as well as a guide to understanding the the most influential rock banks of our time.Each section ofThe Art of Classic Rockfocuses on a well-known band, covering its defining tours and albums to show how the band's iconic designs and graphic styles changed, and to provide an overview of rock history from the period. An introduction to each section puts the images in context, outlining the stage the band and its acts had reached in their development when the particular images and designs displayed were used, and discussing the art and artists behind the work. Each piece of art also features a caption describing exactly what it is, while items with a particular story are accompanied by longer, more detailed text.The Rob Roth collection has been meticulously photographed specifically for this book by photographer Richard Marot who spent hundreds of hours working with a team of technicians to ensure that the images appearing inThe Art of Classic Rockare a sumptuous and accurate representation of the truly stunning Rob Roth Collection.", "title": "The Art of Classic Rock: Rock Memorabilia, Tour Posters, and Merchandise", "price": 33.24, "salesRank": {"Books": 458179}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51plrhi5g6L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0789206110", "081184529X", "1593765029", "1435137051", "1594743266", "1594745439", "0810979993", "1558596062", "8862082045", "1905662327", "0711231265", "1888358092", "0867194081", "081187818X", "081099772X", "0785826777", "0810905965", "1454911921", "0061144622", "1933784717", "1847329195", "0307270165", "B008NR92SI", "0810992353", "1560976578", "B003AIKE6E", "0811861341", "0810991152", "0811861198", "1560252448", "1560256303", "1860742564"], "bought_together": ["0789206110", "081184529X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0789206110", "081184529X", "1594745439", "1594743266"]}}

They lay sticks on the ground, making a path to the burrow, but when a snowfall covers everything, Fletcher switches to plan B. The animals decide to stay up all night to tell Santa where the rabbits have moved. Naturally, they all fall asleep; but, no worries, Santa finds his way and the rabbits invite them all inside for a Merry Christmas.

{"asin": "0061990612", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Crombie, a three-time Macavity Award winner, an Edgar Award nominee, and a New York Times Notable author, stages another New Scotland Yard procedural here, with the team of Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and his partner through the series (now his wife), Inspector Gemma James. It gets off to an eerie start. The body of a rower is discovered tangled in debris in the Thames. The victim is a young woman, Rebecca Meredith, a detective with the Metropolitan Police, who had been undergoing a punishing training regimen in hopes of qualifying for the women&#x2019;s single scull event in the upcoming Olympics. The investigation is especially tricky because of Meredith&#x2019;s professional status. It gets trickier still when Kincaid and James discover a host of suspects, including Meredith&#x2019;s ex-husband and the rowers with whom she trained.

In this exhaustive investigation of the Tea Party movement and its loudest mouthpieces, Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin, Bunch seeks to help liberal and moderate America understand the rage of the right, where they see the nation headed, and how legitimate grievances are being manipulated by opportunists hawking fear to make millions off of working class people. While Bunch's own biases are apparent from page one, he is careful to try to present the far right in an honest light and, according to Bunch, without challenging their perspectives. Maturity in political discourse would be refreshing if Bunch were writing political discourse; he's not. This is investigative reporting. Bunch's primary issue seems to be Beck's opportunism, but his targeting of the only person he doesn't interview will likely make conservatives avoid his book, something Bunch clearly expects. But for liberals or moderates seeking to understand current far right events, the book will fascinate, and likely frighten.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Unable to read relationship cues, Paul is often surprised or angered by the actions of those he thinks he knows well, including his now ex-wife, Sandra, and Grant, a friend who became his daughter's intended without his awareness. Paul's bank is robbed on the day of the wedding by the same man who robbed it two decades earlier, which adds to the trauma and confusion.

While the death of his mother is an ongoing heartache, Lamar receives support from his strict but loving father and his close-knit African-American community. He has truly come to love bowling, and the action revolves (loosely) around his desire to be the recipient of a special ball to be given away by his idol, professional bowler Bubba Sanders. Along the way, Lamar gains, loses, and regains the girl; succumbs to the temptations of easy money by using his bowling skills to hustle some marks at the behest of lowlife Billy Jenks; is physically assaulted by Xavier; pulls an alarm to disrupt his brother's basketball game; and is finally reconciled with X after secretly paying for his algebra tutoring. There is much too much going on, and everything is resolved way too easily, but readers are likely to be pulled along by Lamar's engaging (and frequently hilarious) narration.-Richard Luzer, Fair Haven Union High School, VT (c) Copyright 2010.

His latest writing gig is for Christian Swingles, an online dating service. His remaining energies are devoted to doing his own drug-taking. Then Lloyd gets involved in a plan to rob a local pharmacy. But when the robbery goes horribly wrong, he finds himself on the lam. Grabbing the first Greyhound out of town, he meets Nora, a young woman running from her own demons and fueled by her own varied drug supply. Lloyd instantly falls in love with her, ultimately becoming a pawn in Nora&#x2019;s grandiose project to do harm to the mystery man who got her pregnant and to warn society at large of the dangerous chemical-laden world we live in. With a nod to Katherine Dunn&#x2019;s Geek Love (1989), Stahl (Permanent Midnight, 1995) has created a dark and twisted world, one that challenges our notions of love and beauty.

He thinks it is safely tucked into his pocket and looks forward to his visit from the tooth fairy. Unfortunately, there's a hole in his pocket. Lewis, another opossum in his class, finds the tooth and puts it in his own pocket. While getting ready for bed, Gilbert makes the heartbreaking discovery and Mom suggests writing a note to the tooth fairy explaining the events of the day. Meanwhile, Lewis proudly puts the tooth under his pillow, thinking he will trick the tooth fairy. This easy reader has three short chapters with charming half- and full-page illustrations. The digitally created art has watercolor enhancements. In the second book, Pinkalicious reveals her love of soccer and the wonderful pink soccer ball she received from her dad. Her team name is the Pinksters and, at the latest game, the team is losing, even with the pink ball. Their opponents are the Ravens (dressed in black, of course). Nothing is going right for the team until Goldilicious (the unicorn) sweeps Pinkalicious away from the field and takes her on a quick world tour to observe girls playing soccer in Egypt, Spain, China, and Italy. She gleans enough information to help the Pinksters win the game. The illustrations are bright and appealing. The descriptive language is rhythmical and full of wordplay. Kann's computer-generated collage pictures are bold and appealing and will draw readers into the story. Beginning readers with a passion for pink will want to add this one to their pinktastic list.-Janene Corbin, Rosebank Elementary School, Nashville, TN &#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

It closes with another act of rebellion: the attempted impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton, the long-sought dream of the makers of the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. The first was reported by a participant, George Hewes, the second by a journalist, Michael Kinsley; but both acts reveal much about the values of the nation with the passage of time, and both documents will be of value to anyone seeking to understand America's political history now and in the future.EditorsStephen E. AmbroseandDouglas Brinkley, who are among the best-known American historians working today, understand the importance of such firsthand accounts to chroniclers of the past. They also understand that for too many Americans, \"the word history implies an arid pedantry associated with dusty libraries and musty monographs.\" They've chosen the documents in this first-rate anthology with an eye to proving that history need not be dull, and the selections tell much that the standard textbooks do not, whether it be the mule-meat-and-bad-bean diet of the Confederates besieged at Vicksburg or the cold-war ravings of Beat Generation patron saint Jack Kerouac.

Even the endless taunts of \"Fat Larda\" from resident queen bee Sunny Rasmussen aren't enough to sink her spirits. Laura's parents are departing for military training and she looks forward to spending two weeks with fabulous Aunt Carmen. Then the plan shifts and she is packed off to her grandmother's rundown farm that has, of all things, an intact slave shack. Deeply ashamed of the degradation and cruelty the shack represents, Laura wants nothing to do with it. Knowing Grandma's eagerness to share the significance of the structure and the adjacent family cemetery, the \"Laura Line,\" the teen dreads the visit. When history teacher Mrs. Jacobs proposes a field trip to see the slave shack and cemetery, Laura is mortified by the idea and schemes to get it canceled. But in the ensuing antics, she finds she is descended from a powerful line of women going all the way back to the slave ship Amistad. While a side plot concerning Laura's irritating best friend feels a little forced, the protagonist's emotional transformation will resonate with readers. Generational bonds, notably the growth of the relationship between Laura and her grandmother, are beautifully depicted. With its humor and deep reverence for history, Allen's novel is an engaging treatment of the oft-told tale of looking within for beauty and strength.-Lalitha Nataraj, Escondido Public Library, CA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Starting with the conception by an \"unknown father\" (but glossing over the first 30 years of Jesus' life) and ending with the crucifixion (but avoiding the resurrection), Tolstoy's account is a tight, accessible, and refreshing distillation of Christ's teachings. The author eschews the miracles from Christ's story to focus instead on his messages. Those messages can be pedantic, but generally are conveyed with economy, although some of Christ's teachings--for instance, his views on celibacy for bachelors--are a hard sell today. Tolstoy's preface, in which he explains his conversion to Christianity and justifies his reconstruction of the Gospels by arguing that Jesus never wrote his own version, is a nice addition, as is the appendix of verses the Russian author draws on for his life of Christ.

{"asin": "006196963X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Product DescriptionWhile the major fighting of the war moves to the south in the summer of 1779, a British force of fewer than a thousand Scottish infantry, backed by three sloops-of-war, sails to the desolate and fog-bound coast of New England. Establishing a garrison and naval base at Penobscot Bay, in the eastern province of Massachusetts that would become Maine, the Scots&#x2014;the only British troops between Canada and New York&#x2014;harry rebel privateers and give shelter to American loyalists.In response, Massachusetts sends a fleet of more than forty vessels and some one thousand infantrymen to &#x201C;captivate, kill or destroy&#x201D; the foreign invaders. Second in command is Peleg Wadsworth, a veteran of the battles at Lexington and Long Island, once aide to General Washington, and a man who sees clearly what must be done to expel the invaders.But ineptitude and irresolution lead to a mortifying defeat&#x2014;and have stunning repercussions for two men on opposite sides: an untested eighteen-year-old Scottish lieutenant named John Moore, who will begin an illustrious military career; and a Boston silversmith and patriot named Paul Revere, who will face court-martial for disobedience and cowardice.Grounded firmly in history, inimitably told in Cornwell's thrilling narrative style,The Fortis the extraordinary novel of this fascinating clash between a superpower and a nation in the making.A Q&amp;A with Author Bernard CornwellQ:While you&#x2019;ve written numerous historical novels, including a series set during the American Civil War, this is only your second book set during the American Revolution. What spurred your interest in this period at this time? Will you return to this period again?Cornwell:The original spark was reading a life of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore, who was the man who, more than any other, forged the magnificent army that defeated Napoleon.  If he had not died beating Marshal Soult at Corunna in 1809 then Moore might well have been the hero of Waterloo instead of Wellington, but what intrigued me was to discover that, as a very young man, he had experienced his first taste of battle at Penobscot Bay in 1779. I had never heard of the Penobscot Expedition, so I read more, and discovered this amazing story!  The Penobscot Expedition was an attempt by the militia and navy of Massachusetts to evict a small British garrison from Fort George in what is now Castine, in Maine. Massachusetts assembled the largest rebel fleet of the revolution . . . and lost it all. It's a story of incompetence and lost opportunities, which leads to the worst naval disaster in American history prior to Pearl Harbor. Will I ever write about the revolution again?  I don't know...Q:Of all the battles waged during the Revolution why did you choose to write about the Penobscot expedition? What lessons does this battle offer us today?Cornwell:Choosing the Penobscot Expedition does seem perverse . . . after all, the fighting at Castine has been called 'the forgotten battle', and many people would probably prefer to leave it that way.  But there was the lure of the very young John Moore whose later career would be so eminent, and there was another man in Penobscot Bay who, if anything, would become even more famous. That was Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Revere, the commander of the Massachusetts Artillery Regiment.  I knew very little about Revere when I began to read about the expedition. I knew the famous poem, of course, but beyond that he was simply a shining hero of the revolution, so I was astonished to discover that the only time Revere ever fought the British was at Penobscot, and his record there was shameful.  This was simply too intriguing to ignore, and as the relationship of myth to reality has always fascinated me, I set out to tell the story. Does it have lessons for today? I don't write to teach such lessons . . . maybe you can conclude that war is best left to professionals who know what they're doing.Q:Given the obstacles the Americans faced&#x2014;the colonists were not unified in the desire to break with the crown, the lack of a dedicated, well-trained, and disciplined standing military, perpetual lack of funding, among others&#x2014;are you surprised that we actually succeeded in winning independence?Cornwell:And again there's a gap between myth and reality. It suits America to draw a picture of amateur patriots defeating the well drilled redcoats, but that picture is nonsense. As a result of the Seven Years War there was a firm tradition of militia training in the Thirteen Colonies, and most of the revolution's leaders had served in that war.  Then, early on, the rebels took steps to make a well-drilled and well-trained army. And, of course, they had France and Spain as allies. The largest army at Yorktown was the French army, the smallest was the British.  So no, I'm not surprised. The British government played into the rebel's hands with their stupidity, and the rebels had the inestimable advantage of being able to surrender vast amounts of territory and survive, while the British never had the forces to control that large territory. In 1779, when the novel is set, New England is virtually independent already--there are no British forces in Massachusetts which has its own judiciary, legislature, and administration.Q:While you have written several stand-alone thrillers, most of your fiction centers on war. What draws you to write military fiction? What is the most fascinating aspect of battle for you?Cornwell:Warfare offer something unique; a loosening of the moral laws that govern our lives.  Men and women are released to do things we abhor in peaceful times, and what interests me is how they react. Some react very badly, others attempt to hold onto their humanity through the horror. InThe Fortthere are no monsters, no horrors, but men struggling to understand what is happening to them.  The hero, Peleg Wadsworth, second in command of the American army, emerges as a real hero! A man of moral substance and great strength.  That intrigues me, that he can survive the loosening of moral bonds and emerge more resolute.", "title": "The Fort: A Novel of the Revolutionary War", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 299374}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Mb0YsKmhL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0060512776", "0061578908", "0061969672", "0670816817", "0061969664", "0060934611", "0061969710", "0060748281", "0061969702", "0060935782", "0312187149", "0060888741", "0060935766", "0312156960", "0312206488", "0060888768", "0060956852", "0060932309", "B00BQ83TMG", "0060888644", "0061098639", "0060937181", "006093719X", "0060197005", "0060951974", "0061149047", "0060787120", "006093462X", "0060888628", "0061144835", "0060530510", "0060082739", "0060177136", "0061379743", "0061098620", "0060887184", "0060177667", "0066210801", "0312144474", "0066210844", "0972222014", "0140294295", "0060175001", "0060530499", "0140294368", "0060084537", "0060566701", "0312185758", "014029435X", "0060932287", "0060176342", "0140294341", "0060561564", "0060082747", "0140294376", "0312155239", "0062082388", "0061969729", "0061725455", "0060932295", "0972222030", "0972222006", "0061012645", "0140294392", "B002XULZJA", "0399157859", "0060002522", "0062092650", "0385343078", "0061724386", "0393240207", "0399167315", "0451213432", "0140294384", "0451212576", "0061438375", "1250030056", "0345527380", "0451213424", "0060194251", "006101270X", "0345427505", "0451213416", "0140294309", "0140294333", "0060530472", "B00BQXTCVS", "0060194243", "0007172796", "1557502129", "0312672845", "0060530480", "0345527410", "0060738146", "0345427548", "0060163887", "0142004839", "0060505257"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061969710", "0060887184", "0060512776", "0061969702"]}}

This collaboration between Rollins, the well-known author of the Sigma Force thrillers (contemporary stories with ties to ancient riddles), and Cantrell, author of the atmospheric Hannah Vogel mysteries (set in Berlin in the 1930s), should appeal to their fans, but also to readers who like an action-packed, epic-size story portraying the battle between Good and Evil. --David Pitt", "title": "Innocent Blood: The Order of the Sanguines Series", "price": 4.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 53746}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zLhqok3aL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062135252", "006199104X", "0061784818", "0061991058", "006178480X", "0525953132", "0345526570", "0061785679", "0765317699", "1455525839", "0061785660", "0061785652", "0062017853", "0062017896", "0062017926", "0988672596", "0060763876", "0062017586", "0061965812", "0061784796", "B008SLQ5V6", "0061965804", "0061965839", "1940026067", "1455521205", "0399167315", "0988672545", "0062018019", "0451466454", "B00A1AD6ZU", "1250013003", "0451238915", "0345534700", "B002QGSW8I", "0062279386", "0399167293", "0062213865", "1250013046", "0061965847", "1940026032", "0060763884", "174334273X", "006123141X", "0345537041", "0525953973", "0060521562", "0061965820", "1478305681", "0060763892", "1484966341", "0399159738", "0345537068", "0545652200", "0345526554", "0399158081", "0765320223", "0399162380", "0399160671", "0061230944", "0988672561", "1476717125", "0988672537", "006232005X", "1940026016", "0983735093", "0425269493", "194009514X", "B0007ZNVCM", "0399165894", "0060002484", "0399160477", "0062262394", "0755386531", "1925047733", "0062225901", "1940095174", "0553808036", "0345505751", "0345526546", "1455517135", "125003793X", "0062311077", "0399162496", "1490366342", "1494787717", "0525953493", "006191648X", "0345527801", "1455521310", "0062253719", "0385344341", "1455576425", "1476762066", "1760080489", "1455577537", "1451640218", "0312617879", "0765326906"], "bought_together": ["0062135252", "0061784818"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061785679", "0061991058", "0061784818", "0061785660"]}}

Two families, the Planks and the Dickersons, are mysteriously entwined in this exquisite novel that centers on decades of life at a New Hampshire farm. Youngest daughters Ruth Plank and Dana Dickerson, born on the same day in the same hospital, take turns narrating the struggles they face as children. Ruth feels a coldness from her mother; Dana is unsettled by her kooky parents constantly uprooting her and her brother Ray. Regardless, the Planks pay a yearly visit to the Dickersons no matter where they've ended up living. As the girls come of age, Ruth takes an interest in art, sex, and Dana's brother, Ray, with whom she later reunites, at Woodstock, in a swirl of drugs and mud. Meanwhile, Dana realizes that her desires are directed toward women and sets off to pursue agricultural studies at a university, where she meets Clarice, an assistant professor. As time goes by, the floundering Plank Farm is in danger of being seized by Ruth's former boyfriend, a man who has had his eye on the land for years. As Ruth and Dana pursue love, contemplate children, and search for home, the truth of what unites their families is finally--at long last--revealed, in this beautifully written book.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

William and Louisa appear to be an ordinary married couple, except Louisa is checking out of the marriage in odd ways, and William seems willfully unaware of any problems. While Louisa retreats from social gatherings and displays &#x201C;no noise and barely any life&#x201D; as she disappears beneath the bed covers, William continues on autopilot in his corporate job and daily activities. Then Louisa drops a quiet bomb. William is to build her a house on land she secretly bought. The unspoken ultimatum to her desire is simultaneously vague and sinister. In her need to &#x201C;know for sure that life is moving forward,&#x201D; the threat of Louisa&#x2019;s outgrowing both him and the marriage galvanizes William in unexpected ways. Their marital cracks become even more brutally exposed, especially after a woman from William&#x2019;s past moves into the house across the street.

He, his wife, and his son live there still, filled with the relentless optimism that laces this book. Need a work visa in a tight labor market? Just be a janitor at a garbage-processing plant. Low funds and two-room apartments? Who cares when you&#x2019;re holding your pregnant wife&#x2019;s hand as she bikes along beside you? That&#x2019;s right. Everyone bikes in Amsterdam: the elderly, the brief-cased, the ladder-carrying, the ballroom-gowned. All without helmets. No history of bicycles is complete without a history of bike thievery, and Jordan delivers. The long section on the German occupation has isolated strong points but bogs down listing anything that relates to bikes. American cities lack the critical mass of cyclists to earn adequate bike lanes, yet too few cycle if they have to wear a helmet. So it is odd that an expatriate whose dream job is to monitor all forms of traffic doesn&#x2019;t say much about this quandary or why cycling is more fun for the Dutch. --Dane Carr", "title": "In the City of Bikes: The Story of the Amsterdam Cyclist", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 117032}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HRXbF5phL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0385534574", "0262517817", "0060896426", "1452105251", "1621060039", "0061998540", "060980765X", "1742208746", "0811869989", "1931257299", "1452105006", "9055948993", "1608195759", "1623361311", "0143117963", "0865477728", "0891419411", "1741798957", "1613747268", "0415503892", "0761155589", "0756670241", "1609617436", "188858047X", "030682115X", "1741792746", "0674281381", "193236496X", "1608195384", "0262516128", "1612385435", "2067170627", "0393089584", "0374168237", "0393239322", "0262017334", "1906042284", "1616953004", "076366037X", "0767915062", "1892495708", "0870714198", "0374285810", "1465411380", "9462080046", "0316055433", "019936026X", "0307886085", "1934030872", "0345802985", "0375708154", "0062228838", "1937715094", "0767919408", "0262681706", "0985988908"], "bought_together": ["0385534574"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0385534574", "1621060039", "1465411380", "0802138950"]}}

After a youthful accident left him badly scarred and facing grueling physical therapy, Ariely's treatment required him to accept temporary pain for long-term benefit&mdash;a trade-off so antithetical to normal human behavior that it sparked the author's fascination with why we consistently fail to act in our own best interest. The author, professor of behavioral economics at Duke, leads us through experiments that reveals such idiosyncrasies as the IKEA effect (if you build something, pride and sentimental attachment are likely to give you an inflated sense of its quality) and the Baby Jessica effect (why we respond to one person's suffering but not to the suffering of many). He concludes with prescriptions for how to make real personal and societal changes, and what behavioral patterns we must identify to improve how we love, live, work, innovate, manage, and govern. Self-deprecating humor, an enthusiasm for human eccentricities, and an affable and snappy style make this read an enriching and eye-opening pleasure.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0061988901", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Inspired by the prospect of money and comments made by a writer visiting his middle school, 13-year-old Houdini (nicknamed for his hero) decides to write a &#x201C;kid&#x2019;s novel&#x201D; and finds that it enables him to understand the people around him differently. He has a pretty good handle on his two best friends, but he is less understanding of the people he fears in his working-class Providence neighborhood&#x2014;namely a classmate with a bullying streak and a one-armed Vietnam veteran known as Old Man Jackson. A bit grittier and more believably boylike than most contemporary first-person narratives, this novel has a lot of heart as well. And while a narrator who makes lists is common enough, Houdini&#x2019;s are decidedly more amusing than most.

From the dizzying excitement of flying to the marvel of creating a beautiful snowfall, Wren Darby is finally beginning to enjoy her growing supernatural abilities. Her power is the one thing that she can't share with her best friends. Her boyfriend, Gabriel, who can read minds, is uncomfortable with her talents, driving her toward the dangerous, magical duo Bay and Fiona. Wren also has to deal with her younger sister, who is just coming to terms with her own secret powers. As Wren engages with Bay and Fiona in spite of Gabriel's warnings, she soon realizes that she may be getting in over her head and just might lose Gabriel in the process. However, with the help of her friends and family, she learns that magic isn't the only thing that makes her special. Garvey's lively writing exhibits pleasing emotion and dazzling imagery. However, teens who have not read the first book might be a little lost in this one.-Krista Welz, The North Bergen Public Library, NJ&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

{"asin": "0061989479", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "There are, of course, many books and films, some serious and some fanciful, on the exploits of the James-Younger gang. Unlike most of them, Gardner, an authority on the American West, has shed considerable light on a neglected aspect of the gang&#x2019;s life of crime, the escape of Frank and Jesse James from several posses after the debacle of their attempted robbery of the bank in Northfield, Minnesota. In his description of the origins of the gang and their &#x201C;careers&#x201D; before Northfield, Gardner provides a useful background for novices on the topic. His narrative picks up steam in his detailed, almost bullet-by-bullet account of the failed robbery. In the planning, the James brothers failed to realize that the well-armed citizens of Northfield would resist the attack on a bank that held their savings. Those who escaped the carnage in the town were the subject of a massive manhunt covering hundreds of miles, and the escape of Frank and Jesse was both exciting and remarkable. This is a well-done reexamination of an episode that has become enshrined in Western lore. --Jay Freeman", "title": "Shot All to Hell: Jesse James, the Northfield Raid, and the Wild West's Greatest Escape", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 340115}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51a6nRb0obL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1594161739", "006136827X", "0061368296", "1574415050", "1605984221", "0809095009", "1612002145", "0806144254", "0451239199", "1451654669", "0061864501", "0486470148", "1439154252", "1849085994", "0670025887", "1608191052", "0316167061", "1780961928", "0375705589", "0451415299", "1451645163", "038553292X", "0375405836", "B00ES2877Y", "B000RJO56Y", "1250028507", "0806142669", "1416557075", "0307594084", "0767919408", "0385507771", "1439154244", "1621572099", "0471283622", "0062116290", "0300126387", "1621573133", "1613747926", "0873513932", "1574415557", "0805062904", "1421412217", "141654786X", "1612001793", "0865348995", "1620402033", "1581823258", "0806143509", "076434479X", "0307597059", "0811712281", "0062218298", "1605984434", "0807150045", "1621570835", "1400066778", "1933337508", "0307587827", "0062133438", "1439199582", "1400069726", "0307720896", "0670025445", "1620873656", "1565540972", "0316221023", "0062083481", "1476711844", "0300191073", "1416557067", "0316053740", "1465416056", "0062120395", "0971195056", "0670021725", "161121162X", "0806142855", "0385514379", "0871407868", "159523103X", "B000056H2J", "1596916079", "1611211409", "0465013287", "0399159215", "1400079713", "0062227858", "0670025666", "1426211562", "0873518896", "161200167X", "0805094202", "061834697X", "1594487278", "0544290488", "0316205850", "1939345006", "1594632456", "0813561159", "006206584X"], "bought_together": ["1594161739"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0375705589", "0061368296", "1439154252", "1620873656"]}}

A reconnaissance plane is hit with a new type of weapon that fries the internal electronics of its target. The plane crashes into the South China Sea in an area considered international waters. Unfortunately, a coup within the Chinese government has put a new leader in power who contends those waters belong to China and is willing to do anything to make his point. McLanahan, a retired air-force general now heading a tech company that has been working on modifying older planes that don&#x2019;t rely on computers, is called into action.

(I want to make one thing as clear as possible: How your mama made it is the right way! I'm going to bring it to you how my mama made it, which is the only right way for me.)These stories and recipes come from my heart. They are a gift from my ancestors, but the ability to have them heard is a gift from you. Take a seat at theSouthern Platetable; you're with family now.FromSouthern Plate: Lela&rsquo;s Fried Fruit PiesThese are my great-grandmother&rsquo;s pies. I remember Lela standing in the kitchen humming as she fried these, placing the crispy treats on a paper towel&ndash;lined plate next to the stove as she dipped more into the hot oil in her cast-iron skillet. The entire house smelled of peaches, because that was her favorite kind of fruit pie.If you&rsquo;re yearning for an old-fashioned fried pie like Granny used to make, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. This recipe can easily be modified to accommodate your favorite dried fruit. Feel free to modify it to accommodate your own tastes. Most folks start out making these with dried apples but even though we love apples, nothing can beat a fried pie made with dried peaches.Filling6 to 7 ounces dried fruit (I used peaches; you can also use apples, apricots, or other dried fruit)2 cups water1 cup sugar1 tablespoon lemon juice1&frasl;2 teaspoon ground cinnamonPlace the dried fruit in a large saucepan and add the water and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the fruit is tender and the sugar is dissolved, about 20 minutes. Add all the other ingredients and mash together with a potato masher or fork. Set aside while you prepare the dough.Dough2 cups all-purpose flour1 teaspoon salt1&frasl;2 cup shortening1&frasl;2 cup milk, plus more if neededVegetable oilDirectionsTo make the dough, in a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a long-tined fork. Add the milk and stir until the dough sticks together. Divide into 10 portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface into a 5- or 6-inch circle. Place 2 tablespoons of filling in each. Wet the edges and fold over, crimping with a fork.In a large skillet, pour the oil to a depth of 1&frasl;4 inch and heat over medium heat. Add the fruit pies to the hot oil and fry until browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes, turning as needed. Remove to a paper towel&ndash;lined plate.Makes 10 pies.FromSouthern Plate: Baked Macaroni and CheeseMacaroni and cheese is a must-have whenever kids are around, and there are countless takes on this classic comfort food, so I couldn&rsquo;t bring you just one. This is the recipe for the baked version, which is for those who prefer stringy, extra cheesy mac and cheese. It&rsquo;s best made in an ovenproof bowl rather than a 9 x 13-inch pan.Ingredients2 1&frasl;2 cups uncooked macaroni2 1&frasl;2 tablespoons all-purpose flour1 1&frasl;4 teaspoons saltBlack pepper to taste (I use about 1 teaspoon)4 tablespoons (1&frasl;2 stick) margarine, cut into small slices3 cups shredded cheddar cheese1 cup milkDirectionsFirst, preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Next, cook the pasta according to the package directions until tender and drain. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and pepper and set aside. Spray an oven-safe bowl or dish with cooking spray. Place half of the macaroni in the bowl or dish. Sprinkle half of the flour mixture over the top and then top with half of the margarine slices. Sprinkle 11&frasl;2 cups of the cheese over the top. Repeat. Pour the milk over all. Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until bubbly. Serve hot.Makes 8 servings.", "title": "Southern Plate: Classic Comfort Food That Makes Everyone Feel Like Family", "price": 12.74, "salesRank": {"Books": 59709}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Hmhz9NwL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0761174907", "1401605435", "0762438649", "1401600360", "0770436803", "1609078160", "1401600522", "1401604889", "0062225227", "B0055X4CRO", "1938879015", "1401605052", "0307351408", "1401605001", "0307381374", "0307717852", "1416564071", "1476713219", "0061658197", "0385345003", "1620931451", "0307464288", "0848739639", "160907324X", "0848739620", "0307465233", "0061997188", "1580088538", "0848742230", "1906868972", "0804139423", "1620930900", "1579654584", "1621080196", "0848734815", "1600859038", "0804186626", "0848742249", "1626360383", "1606419315", "1940772079", "161765101X", "1401602274", "1401601731", "1118282396", "0770436994", "1937994341", "1607745127", "1579127843", "1936493837", "0898216397", "1118020359", "0375400354", "1569757828", "0848742257", "0975539655", "0848739531", "1401602142", "1561488003", "0848702980", "0848732669", "1617651001", "0762451637", "1401604846", "1607745046", "0307464881", "1439148260", "1462113281", "1118067754", "0848736435", "1484711084", "1620930293", "0848743555", "B00H70KMTA", "1933494689", "161243181X", "0307961338", "0307954870", "1936493535", "1476745129", "B007QT4GNU", "1580089801", "1118130766", "1401310605", "1620931508", "1609076761", "1609613546", "1621087018", "1620871653", "0770436781", "1118383583", "0848742281", "157965438X", "1479360635", "084871816X", "038534466X", "076278752X", "1476763208", "0517568136", "0898218373"], "bought_together": ["0761174907", "1401605435"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0761174907", "1401605435", "1609078160", "0804139423"]}}

She's helped them cope with grief; encouraged them to be moral, compassionate, and considerate individuals; shown them how to handle adversity; and set them on the path to understanding and living happy, well-adjusted lives.Now, in this long-awaited book, Dr. Laura turns to an emotionally explosive subject that has touched all our lives: betrayal and the desire for revenge. And for the first time, she shares her own personal experiences with betrayal, humiliation, and pain, which have led her to a powerful desire for revenge. Intimate and honest, Dr. Laura connects with her readers as never before and puts this subject into context:I concluded that betrayals are frightening, destructive, painful, humiliating, demoralizing, and so very, very hard to repair. Betrayals undermine people, relationships (marriages and families), institutions (churches, schools, businesses, government, politics)&#8212;everything. The entire fabric of humanity depends upon people depending upon each other for their word, honesty, and loyalty.Millions of Dr. Laura's listeners struggle with the idea of taking revenge and how to accept when it cannot be achieved. For many who have been betrayed, justice may never be served, she reminds us. Empathetic yet never saccharine, direct yet never harsh, Dr. Laura encourages readers to explore their feelings and learn to get beyond them, supplying tools they can use to achieve fulfilling, contented lives free of rancor and the need to settle scores.Powerful and thought-provoking,Surviving a Shark Attack (on Land)gives readers the emotional defenses they need to overcome the worst life will throw at them, whether it's a cheating spouse, a lying sibling, or a ruthless colleague.", "title": "Surviving a Shark Attack (On Land): Overcoming Betrayal and Dealing with Revenge", "price": 10.4, "salesRank": {"Books": 860350}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519XMvN9lYL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003A02WX0", "0060976497", "0060520620", "0060577878", "0061142824", "0060933798", "0061142840", "B001OW5OLI", "0060520612", "0060280662", "0060928069", "0060929448", "0060512601", "0060191384", "0060173084", "0679416412", "0060833637", "B002SB8QJQ", "0060753234"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060520620", "B001OW5OLI", "0060976497", "0061142824"]}}

Though Drummond grew up in Oklahoma, she never imagined she&#xFFFD;d end up there for good. After four years of college in Los Angeles, Drummond was only making a pit stop home before moving to Chicago. A chance encounter with a devastatingly masculine cowboy in a local bar changes everything. Though several months elapse before Marlboro Man calls her, the spark between them ignites as soon as they start dating. A rancher with deep roots in the land he works, Marlboro Man isn&#xFFFD;t going anywhere, which means Drummond has to decide whether, to be with him, she&#xFFFD;s willing to give up her dream of moving to Chicago. By the time Marlboro Man proposes, the decision is made, and Drummond prepares to marry the love of her life and discover what being a rancher&#xFFFD;s wife will entail. Charming and bright, Drummond&#xFFFD;s story will be an inspiration to those who despair of finding old-fashioned, lasting love. --Kristine Huntley", "title": "The Pioneer Woman: Black Heels to Tractor Wheels--A Love Story", "price": 8.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 59281}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aTNAeQeSL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061658197", "0061997188", "0062225227", "0061996556", "0307381374", "0061996572", "0062219111", "0307465233", "0062219200", "0062219081", "0062219146", "0062297503", "0062219170", "0062219154", "1451642601", "B00BR9TIYW", "1476763208", "006221912X", "B00FHVRVK4", "0743278135", "0738212792", "1906868972", "1416564071", "1907804137", "0743276949", "B003D2P9A8", "0804139423", "0316099783", "1476763305", "0989266451", "1250044545", "0670026093", "1250007038", "0425255697", "0307451011", "0307987205", "0802836194", "0544217624", "0385349173"], "bought_together": ["0061658197", "0062225227"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061997188", "0061658197", "0062225227", "0804139423"]}}
{"asin": "0061997145", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Singular in quality, if not unique in plot or tone, Young's WWI novel, her adult debut after coauthoring the Lionboy YA trilogy, follows two emblematic couples: Peter and Julia Locke, lovely and well-placed until their relationship disintegrates under the pressure of war and changing conventions, and, more centrally, working class Riley and posh Nadine, who, in a nice bit of symmetry, are hampered before the war by the very upper crustiness that the Lockes embody, but are subsequently more free to love each other and better suited by their modernity and openness to survive. Still, separation and a terrible injury ensure uncertainty and tension. The plot has a certain Atonement feel to it&mdash;working-class boy is semiadopted by upper-middle-class family and educated beyond his station, then falls unacceptably in love with their independent-minded daughter and goes to war while she becomes a nurse&mdash;but the similarities become increasingly irrelevant as Young's characters come into their own and easily shoulder the burden of escorting readers through an unsensationalized and thoughtful story of English class, world war, and that universal constant&mdash;love.

{"asin": "0061997196", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In 1945, as the Allies readied the complicated plans for the Nuremberg trials, religion was a consideration, per the Geneva Convention&#x2019;s regulations. As award-winning religion reporter and first-time book author Townsend puts it, they had to determine &#x201C;whether to supply the architects of the Holocaust with a Christian minister to comfort their spirits as they explained to the world the murder of six million Jews.&#x201D; The Lutheran minister the Allies provided was Henry Gerecke, a middle-aged U.S. Army chaplain from south St. Louis. Along with Father Sixtus O&#x2019;Connor, a Catholic, Chaplain Gerecke spent months ministering to the top tier of Nazi criminals. In a clear, gripping, and extensively researched narrative, Townsend raises the hard questions of good and evil, forgiveness and retribution; and, also, whether these killers, obeying orders and ignoring morality, deserved spiritual succor in what were, for many of them, their final days. There is much to ponder and bemoan in this detailed report of the trials and of a brave, kindly pastor moving through the &#x201C;most frightening experience of his life.&#x201D; --Eloise Kinney", "title": "Mission at Nuremberg: An American Army Chaplain and the Trial of the Nazis", "price": 12.74, "salesRank": {"Books": 16524}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518rUIWbTjL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0307269817", "0062105094", "1595230912", "1250040639", "143353892X", "1426211562", "0062116290", "161039156X", "0307889750", "0764211226", "0451415299", "1596384492", "1596382171", "1433542404", "1433542943", "0465031250", "143354069X", "1433513129", "0764211013", "1451477910", "1433540835", "0805496742", "0802867618", "1595231048", "0465050972", "1433544652", "1433543133", "0199927928", "1590176812", "0310275466", "0465080243", "1615216170", "0062227238", "1476741123", "1433681145", "0985365153", "0060670207", "161315027X", "0061791083", "1499514174", "1469612941", "0743299124", "1433531313", "0670025194", "158134466X", "0310513898", "080103180X", "080284345X", "0062071483", "1630881694", "1581348525", "1596388153", "1401688861", "0465013287", "1610170857", "1884527388", "0801015723", "0877844054", "1780967268", "1433544148", "0306806614", "0802869610", "1595230890", "140020545X", "1107407656", "1433540878", "0310499232", "1414383789", "0849902010", "0061146668", "0802403565", "1586178334", "B00FRE6OB8", "0764210041", "0802806279", "0982710194", "0830840613", "0684829495", "1433532379", "0781410320", "0781410355", "1595552464", "1595231129", "0691154813", "1630885703", "1468309188", "1107064902", "1433531399", "0802412041", "1433536951", "0143123254", "1628240997", "1587433214", "1601782845", "162136593X", "111890110X", "0802458386", "1620405687", "1414336241", "1414339631"], "bought_together": ["1595230912"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1595230912", "0307269817", "0451415299", "0062116290"]}}

She lives with her mom and brother in California, until she starts to receive visions of her divine purpose involving a handsome young man, a forest fire, and sadness. The teen and her mom slowly piece together her visions and realize that the fire is near Jackson, WY. Clara's family packs up and moves there so that she can fulfill her destiny. She meets the boy from her vision, Christian, but he already has a girlfriend and a popular set of friends. She tries to get closer to him, but is distracted by friends, trying to learn to fly, and a cute, but annoying cowboy. Despite her brief visions, Clara doesn't know much about her angelic nature. She meets Angela, who is also an angel, and guesses that Clara is too. Clara learns that fallen angels have dark wings and will try to take her powers. The day of her purpose comes and she must make an impossible choice&#8212;do what she is supposed to do or save the boy she loves.

{"asin": "0061993158", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this entertaining memoir, Paul recounts an unanticipated life-changing experience that began when his wife accepted a three-year work assignment in Beijing. After resettling their three young children from suburban New Jersey to China, Paul, a music and basketball journalist who played guitar only as a hobby, embarked on an exploration of local culture and music. The search prompted his transition from writing about music to being a bona fide rock star in the band Woodie Alan, a cross-cultural blues group named after Alan and his Chinese band member, Woodie Wu, a guitarist with a Stevie Ray Vaughn tattoo. Paul blogged about his Chinese experience and also wrote a column on it for the Wall Street Journal's Web site. His story, however, is much more than a musical and journalistic victory dance.

{"asin": "0061995363", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "First published in 1954,The Alice B. Toklas Cookbookis one of America's great works of recollection, culinary and otherwise. Toklas lived, cooked, and kept house in Paris and rural France with her companion, Gertrude Stein, from 1908 until Stein's death in 1947. During that time she cooked for and shared food with friends, including Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Thornton Wilder, accumulating recipes for the simple and haute bourgeois dishes compiled in the book. She also saw and remembered all, from life in the high bohemian circle she and Stein occupied; to France during two world wars; to the United States, visited in the '30s; to summers passed in a paradisiacal country retreat at Biligin in France. These and more Toklas depicts vividly and acerbically, all viewed through the prism of food and good eating.Woven within chapters such as \"Dishes for Artists,\" \"Food in French Homes,\" and \"The Vegetable Gardens at Biligin,\" the 300 recipes run the gamut from hors d'oeuvres and salads to breads, entr&#xE9;es, drinks, and sweets. Original (and sometimes whimsical) dishes like Stuffed Artichokes Stravinsky, Gigot de la Clinque, and Bavarian Cream Perfect Love appear among more traditional offerings, such as Boeuf Bourguignon, Chicken &#xE0; l'Estargon, and Green Peas &#xE0; la Goodwife. Many of the recipes (which are written in abbreviated-narrative style) will be attempted only by adventurous cooks with time (and, in some cases, money) to spare. The rest of us will enjoy reading the recipes, the droll reminiscences, and the fantasizing about a time when the dishes' creation could be relatively commonplace. The tour of this era and its food, by one of literature's great cook-writers, is obligatory reading.--Arthur Boehm--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Alice B.

Simmons also discusses at length Cohen&#x2019;s impressive body of work, including poetry and prose as well as songs (his iconic &#x201C;Hallelujah&#x201D; has been covered by more than 300 artists), mentions his numerous bouts of depression, and recounts his unfortunate financial difficulties when his former manager stole funds from his retirement account. A must for anyone interested in one of the most influential songwriters of our time. --June Sawyers", "title": "I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen", "price": 11.12, "salesRank": {"Books": 54750}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/811GT0InLwL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0307595838", "1451657846", "0679748253", "006112561X", "B000I2J62I", "B0067LY4WG", "0771021879", "B005F8CL1S", "1613747586", "B001RTP3Z0", "0061173754", "0393082059", "1400033624", "B00006NSH8", "006112558X", "B0012GN1L6", "B001RTP3YQ", "B002KREVE2", "0679755411", "B00005Q45W", "B003VSVWA0", "B003OWD2EC", "B000NOKA0S", "1932183930", "B000007VW5", "1780383029", "B0096ELJ9M", "B0012GMVXU", "B0012GMW7A", "B0012GMZKE", "1576877256", "B000NOKA1W", "0679427295", "0825612381", "1480386286", "B0012GMVDK", "1611800331", "1451657854", "B000F8O4AE", "B001BKNABO", "B0043JJ55K", "B0012GMVY4", "B000NOKA1C", "B000002C31", "B000001EZK", "B007C2DRDG", "B0012GMX3S", "0991344707", "B000G73UEU", "1770411283", "0399159460", "B00DW5IM9Q", "B0012GMV5I", "1847727158", "0743228154", "0233003002", "0670025631", "B000XJM7XQ", "B00I3TWZ9Y", "B006H3MIV8", "B000051WCE", "B003VSVWAA", "1847728022", "159420473X", "0670002348", "0738900672", "067000376X", "0292717326", "B002LLDTA4", "0224008412", "0898791499", "0062127241", "B0000029DD", "B003SBZEHM", "B00AKV1K9O", "0062222562", "1605984817", "0062190830", "B00HHYEOY0", "B004LAIU4I", "B00G34XP3Q", "0385536577", "B00E0P8VQQ", "0316055433", "0770435572", "0679601392", "B00GUXO12O", "0300136625", "0307957128", "B00HE011DE", "0307596907", "067443000X", "140006922X", "0385521707", "0306812657", "0789322633", "B00BPXKWCM", "0307743721", "0385347545"], "bought_together": ["0307595838", "006112561X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["006112561X", "1613747586", "0307595838", "0393082059"]}}

I was the assistant to his editor at that time, Edite Kroll.  Was I lucky!Q:What was his creative process like and how did you two work together?Markiet:I remember most clearly that Shel was meticulous in every aspect of a book... the trim size, the paper, the binding and of course, the contents.  No piece of the whole was too small to consider carefully.  He looked at every spread to be sure art and text were positioned the best way possible.  And, he considered every word and expression until it, and the whole text, was just right.  I learned how a book is made in the best possible way.Q:Shel passed away in 1999 but more than ten years later you&rsquo;re publishingEvery Thing On It, which includes tons of his never-before-seen poems and drawings.

{"asin": "0061995215", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This study of a January 1811 slave uprising and march on New Orleans exhumes the deliberately obscured and \"largest act of armed resistance against slavery in the history of the United States.\" Historian Rasmussen expands on scarce source material to provide a complex context for a revolt that dwarfed such better-known rebellions as Nat Turner's and Denmark Vesey's, a stealthily organized uprising of 500 armed slaves dressed in military uniforms marching on and trying to conquer New Orleans. The author ties together diverse political, economic, and cultural threads in describing the rise (and brutal suppression) of the \"ethnically diverse, politically astute, and highly organized\" army, and investigates why this \"story more Braveheart than Beloved\" was consigned to historical footnote. While the book's ambition occasionally exceeds its grasp, it vividly evokes the atmosphere of New Orleans of the early 19th century and how a recalcitrant, French-rooted Louisiana and some Spanish possessions in the Deep South were incorporated into the expanding American nation though brutal revenge justice and political pressures.

S. 38, Nate Wright is up to his usual entertaining tricks in the sixth book of Peirce&#x2019;s best-selling series. He jumps on (and breaks) a beanbag chair in the library, repeatedly hits his head with an empty water bottle, and draws a steady stream of irreverent cartoons. For the first half of the book, Nate embarrasses himself in a variety of ways: getting stage fright in front of the entire school, earning a &#x201C;D&#x201D; in social studies, and being mocked by the school&#x2019;s most popular guy. But things turn around with the apparent help of his friend&#x2019;s good-luck charm, and Nate mends his reputation and the hurt feelings of his band&#x2019;s lead singer. Peirce focuses on Nate&#x2019;s school challenges rather than on his home life, but there is a sweet moment when Nate&#x2019;s father confesses that he wasn&#x2019;t a stellar sixth-grade student either. Peirce&#x2019;s drawings are amusing but also surprisingly expressive, capturing everything from the agony of facing a teacher&#x2019;s tantrum to the joy of a surprise free period.

{"asin": "0061991007", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Entering its fourth season on July 25, AMC's critically acclaimed TV series Mad Men takes place on Madison Avenue during the early 1960s in the fictional Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce ad agency. Inspired by the TV series, L.A. freelance writer Vargas-Cooper launched a nicely designed and engaging blog, the Footnotes of Mad Men, to survey not only the show but also the real-world historical and cultural artifacts of that period. Now her attractive blog has been adapted into an equally attractive book. As Vargas-Cooper sees it, the series is \"about the culture clash and contradictions that occurred during the twilight of the Eisenhower era, the great societal shake-up of the 1960s\" and its impact on modern America. She focuses on advertising, design, films, literature, politics, sex, style, and the workplace in order to probe \"the most dramatic cultural shift in the 20th century.\" She begins by detailing all the series' regular characters and then moves on to profile real-life ad man Leo Burnett (Tony the Tiger, the Pillsbury Doughboy, the Marlboro Man), followed by everything from skinny ties, condoms, John Cheever and Frank O'Hara to Jackie Kennedy's White House tour on CBS and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. All are neatly linked with specific TV episodes, making this both an entertaining read and the definitive companion book for the series.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0061997420", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Butler's inventive third book is dedicated \"For no one\" and begins with an eerie prologue about the saturation of the world with a damaging light. Suitably forewarned, the reader is introduced to an unexceptional no-name family. All should be idyllic in their newly purchased home, but they are shadowed by an unwelcome \"copy family.\" In the face of the copy mother, the mother sees her heretofore unrealized deterioration. Things only get worse as the father forgets how to get home from work; the mother starts hiding in the closet, plagued by an omnipresent egg; while the son gets a female \"special friend\" and receives a mysterious package containing photos of dead celebrities. The territory of domestic disillusion and postmodern dystopia is familiar from other tales, but Butler's an endlessly surprising, funny, and subversive writer. This subversion extends to the book's design: very short titled chapters with an abundance of white space. Not so much a novel as a literary tapestry, the book's eight parts are separated by blank gray pages. To Butler (Scorch Atlas), everything in the world, even the physical world, is gray and ever-changing, and potentially menacing. (Apr.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

In October 1958, reports of a white girl living among the Bashilele tribe of headhunters shock young American missionary Amanda Brown; her dashing police captain suitor, Pierre Jardin; her conniving maid, Cripple; and the rest of the diamond-mining outpost of Belle Vue. Could the self-possessed teen known as \"Ugly Eyes\" be the same Belgian who vanished from the community as an infant 13 years earlier? In any case, what should become of her? Answering these questions proves unexpectedly complex as well as surprisingly dangerous. Myers (Butter Safe than Sorry and 17 other Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries) spins an engagingly devious yarn, but what truly elevates this effort is the warmth with which she evokes the now-vanished Congo where she spent much of her childhood.

{"asin": "0061985880", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 8-11-Paranormals and Light Court Faeries want to return to their world. Evie is an Empty One and can make a gate that will let them through. When they try to force her to do so, she rebels, mainly because they tell her she must do it. She formerly worked for the International Paranormal Containment Agency (IPCA), and they apparently forced her to do things she did not want to do. Confused? For readers who are new to the story, it feels as though there is a secret club of vocabulary and references to previous events. The story is episodic, with Evie repeatedly making the same mistakes, and with her near-misses neatly resolved. However, the first two books have been popular and there will be demand from those readers for this book. It is a clean paranormal romance-Evie even says (somewhat annoyingly) \"BLEEP\" instead of any swear words, and the sex factor is very low, with only a bit of touching and a few stolen kisses.

Tom and Atticus set out on an adventure of a lifetime that takes them across hundreds of miles and deep into an enchanting but dangerous winter wonderland. Little did they know that their most difficult test would lie ahead, after they returned home... Following Atticus is ultimately a story of transformation: how a five-pound puppy pierced the heart of a tough-as-nails newspaperman, opening his eyes to the world's beauty and its possibilities. An unforgettable saga of adventure, friendship, and the unlikeliest of family, it's an inspiring tale of finding love and discovering your true self.Edited By - Tom Ryan.Binding - Hard.Pages - 276.Publisher - William Morrow.Year - 2011.ISBN - 9780061997105.", "title": "Following Atticus - Forty-Eight Peaks, One Little Dog and an Extraordinary Friendship", "price": 17.91, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413A2bozKVL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1426742568", "B009WJ03MA", "1931271240", "1466352752", "0761129758", "0767931343", "1401324290", "076111937X", "B003A02X3Y", "0061537934", "B000BP2M46", "0765330555", "B0001XXF30", "1594204780", "B00AK3ML3G", "0983097704", "0738214671", "0062223704", "1890060232", "0385347669", "0670024783", "1611458315", "B00B9ZCS46", "0425252868", "0736948511", "1400064163", "0385537131"], "also_viewed": ["1426742568", "0765330342", "B00BXU41EM", "B00DIL2XGM", "B001SERNUC", "0156034506", "1401310753", "079383645X", "B000GG4I6U", "1934028320", "B0001XXF30", "0312662955", "144013779X", "0825305683", "B005D1HVAS", "B0069ZN3BI", "0807573361", "1890060232", "B000BP2M46", "1499629583", "0307279464", "1466352752", "0061537969", "0615782507", "1400204720", "0307476073", "0800720539", "B000HP0ETU", "0803240120", "B007CUIYLS", "0060730552", "1929173067", "1934028444", "1400080460", "1599216108", "193834023X", "0060850914", "B00EDA4JBE", "1401310893", "030795207X", "0547745524", "1476739145", "0007303009", "0825306930", "1451683561", "1250029465", "B009WJ03MA", "1476709629", "1931271240", "0898869021", "0738216062", "B005AQLIOQ", "B007B4Q002", "0615883508", "0897328493", "0786447672", "B0012VI8QY", "0980167264"], "bought_together": ["1426742568"]}, "categories": [["Books", "Travel", "United States", "Northeast", "New England"]]}

In alternating voices, sunny optimist Prudence, who inherited the money-losing spread from her uncle; boozy blogger Seth; tween Sara, who raises poultry to console a life otherwise torn apart by two warring parents; and old-coot Earl, who has a mysterious and illustrious past, put their shaky lives and a dilapidated house together by discovering the best and forgiving the worst of each other.

This jolly book shows how a little crisis, a little problem solving, and a lot of laughs can go a long way toward making family members reconnect with one other. Annie has a couple of problems. One is that her father, mother, brother, and sister are too busy to pay attention to her. They&#x2019;re always glued to their computers, handheld devices, and video games. Annie&#x2019;s other problem is that things get stuck to her, like bubble gum, cotton candy, ice cream, marshmallows, lollipops, you name it. When Annie sets about making a peanut-butter and honey sandwich&#x2014;well, you can probably figure out what happens.

Robbie is looking forward to spending the summer with his grandmother, Maddy. He likes her eccentric stories, he likes that wild animals come right up to her, and he likes how Maddy makes his parents nervous. Robbie often feels that his parents, accomplished professional musicians, love their instruments more than him. Over the course of the summer, Maddy helps him realize that he can be brave enough to express his feelings openly even though his mother might not be capable of saying \"I love you\" in return. This story is well paced and rhythmic in its dialogue, lending itself well to a group read-aloud.

You&rsquo;ll become a master at:Determining your current metabolism&mdash;and then reprogramming itFocusing on body fat percentage rather than body weightSetting measurable, motivating goals (short- and long-term, internal and external)Following a customized, efficient, diverse exercise plan that makes you feel energetic and strongHarnessing the powers of sleep, supplements, water, and stress management, all in perfect sync to optimize your body&rsquo;s performanceBody Confidencecreator Mark Macdonald knows that weight loss doesn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum, and he has made room for &ldquo;real life&rdquo; at every stage of this program. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll be introduced to some of Venice Nutrition&rsquo;s extraordinary success stories, and learn how to stay on track no matter what life throws at you. Packed with recipes, nutrition guides, exercise journals, and Venice Nutrition&rsquo;s proven goal-setting tools,Body Confidencewalks you through every step of a process that has already changed thousands of lives.Getting in shape (and staying in shape) no longer has to mean feeling deprived and hungry, living with low energy, being irritable and anxious, or obsessing about food and exercise. There is a way to make looking and feeling your best a permanent way of life.A Q&amp;A between Chelsea Handler and Mark MacDonaldChelsea Handleris an accomplished stand-up comic and actress, as well as the bestselling author ofMy Horizontal Life.  She is the star of her own late-night show on E!,Chelsea Lately; was one of the stars ofGirls Behaving Badly; and has appeared onThe Tonight Show with Jay Lenoas well asLate Night with David Letterman.Handler:Seriously, how can eating more meals actually get rid of my muffin top?MacDonald:I know, it goes against all the dieting rules.  We are trained to think, eat less, move more, and lose fat.  This may work for a moment, but soon your body stops progressing, because your body actually holds onto fat when you skip meals.  The reality is your body is a \"re-fuel as it goes\" machine.  Meaning, you need to eat balanced meals throughout the day to maintain a steady supply of energy.   By eating right when you get up, then every 3&ndash;4 hours, and then before bed, your blood sugar levels and hormones will stay in balance.  This state of balance causes your body to consistently release its stored fat, which then gets burned as energy in your muscle tissue.  This is how your muffin top will permanently become a thing of the past!Handler:You know I love my Belvedere; can I drink on the program and still get lean?MacDonald:Of course!  The last thing I would ever remove from your program is your Belvedere!  The cool thing is that making your program part of your world is never about what you cannot have; it is actually about being clear on what you want and then working together to fit that into your program.  Belvedere and all alcohol is totally fine in moderation.  The trick is to find the right balance with your food, exercise, and alcohol to ensure that you achieve yourBody Confidencegoals.  Here are three adjustments to make when it is Belvedere time that will keep your metabolism humming and minimize the effects of alcohol:First off, let&rsquo;s limit drinking to 1&ndash;2 times per week, with a max of 2 drinks at a time.  Now I know there are all sizes and shapes of drinks, so let&rsquo;s define a drink as a shot of Belvedere (or any hard liquor), 6 oz of wine (red or white), and 12 oz of beer (preferably light)Second, avoid eating all starchy carbohydrates (rice, pasta, potato, etc.) when you drink.  Alcohol actually gets metabolized by the body before food does; so when you eat heavy carbohydrates along with alcohol, your meal contains too many calories and the result is typically extra fat storage (definitely not the goal!)And third, let&rsquo;s be cautious with drinking before bed, and preferably stop drinking within two hours of bed.  Alcohol affects the quality of your sleep and interrupts your sleep cycles.  Since you are always on the go, you already know how important your sleep is for your daily energy.   Your quality of sleep also affects the speed of your metabolism, which we both know is a big component of your burning body fat and getting and staying lean.Handler:Mark, you know my schedule gets crazier by the day; how can I make it all work?MacDonald:Tell me about it!  Making your health work is never about doing more; it is actually about becoming better and more efficient at what you do. This way, whether you are going on location to tapeChelsea Lately in Australia, or performing a show at Caesars Palace or  just powering through a hectic day in LA,  you will have the tools to keep your blood sugar balanced and  your muscles optimally activated to burn your  body fat up, without having to do more!With your food, it is a simple process.  You will quickly know the right amount of calories, protein, fat, and carbs per meal and then basically you can eat any food, any time, as long as it stays in the right combination.  This provides you the flexibility to eat anywhere your day takes you and still stay on plan.Now with your exercise, let&rsquo;s get each training session working at maximum capacity.  We need a combination of fat burning and high intensity cardio, utilizing the best movements to activate all of your muscle fibers (since fat is burned in muscle).

Modern Oracles are forbidden to alter the future. Charlotte once tried to change an outcome based on a vision, with disastrous results. Now, under the tutelage of her aunt, also a seer, Charlotte struggles to contain her visions and keep them from getting through. Her new visions are too powerful, however, and break through all of Charlotte's defenses. The bloody and gruesome scenes she sees are of a serial killer's victims-her classmates. After a second murder, Charlotte gets a text from a stranger named Smith, imploring her to change the future and prevent more attacks. He can show her how, if she'll just let him into her mind. Can Charlotte change the future without repercussions? Is she willing to take the chance? Pike's newest novel is a thrilling paranormal mystery with a hint of romance. Charlotte is a likable and sympathetic character coping with larger-than-life problems. Her situation as an outsider is universal, even while the cause is firmly rooted in the realm of fiction. Teen girls, fans of Pike's previous novels, and those who are just discovering her will enjoy this unique, quick read.&#x2014;Heather Miller Cover, Homewood Public Library, AL", "title": "Sleep No More (Charlotte Westing Chronicles)", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 906766}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/917WMgxLjuL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1595146520", "0062293605", "0545654572", "1442445831", "B00HQOFIA0", "1423176383", "1423175123", "0062071246", "1402294603", "125005088X", "006222560X", "1908844965", "0373211082", "0399162429", "0399167838", "0545522250", "1442416890", "0062265970", "0316370312", "1442474262", "1250039606", "149609946X", "0062014552", "0316134074", "0062280678", "0385742673", "0373211198", "0062117297", "1442466308", "0062220993", "0062011197", "0062318322", "0399159452", "1595143211", "0803739265", "0525953698", "1442484233", "006212241X", "1423153294", "0374384673", "0312642970", "1619630656", "0062220004", "1595146512", "0062233653", "142316332X", "0373211120", "0062059998", "1595147055", "0385741413", "1442445629", "0062245384", "0385743378", "0545424941", "1595146504", "0545424968", "0062211196", "0062278967", "1423184629", "0374346674", "0399159622", "1595146385", "1423157427", "0385743130", "0062327968", "0373779054", "1606842471", "0451415205", "1442421800", "1619633612", "0061999008", "0805097716", "B00GQQ77IU", "1442435003", "0399161864", "0062198505", "1442405910", "1599901684", "1402289421", "0763666947", "B00FUMD46U", "1423178203", "0670016780", "1250003334", "B00HQOFAKI", "125004443X", "0761463275", "0312594445", "0373210914", "0062072099", "0062083295", "0765329603", "0316197157", "1606844792", "0061961221", "080509461X", "1595145931", "0312642962", "038574126X", "0547959109"], "bought_together": ["0062293605"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062293605", "0061668141", "0061668117", "1423175123"]}}

Lehane's books reflect our morally complex times, when the borders between right and wrong are somewhat blurry.Private investigator Patrick Kenzie is in the middle of a personal crisis--he's lost his passion for the profession, and is tired of people with their \"predictable vices, their predictable needs and wants and dormant desires.\" Angie Gennaro, his occasional sweetheart, lifelong friend, and fellow investigator has quit the business. She's still deeply resentful about Patrick's handling of the Amanda McCready case, the focus ofGone, Baby, Gone. Without Angie, private investigating has lost its fizz.The suicide of a former client, Karen Nichols, gives Kenzie his investigative itch back. Six months earlier, Kenzie tracked down a stalker who had been harassing Nichols, and put an end to his heinous hobby. But Nichols needed more help than this PI could ever have imagined. \"She'd been drowning, and I'd been busy.\" The successful, middle-class young woman had been sinking into a sea of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution, hitting the bottom when she jumped from the Boston Custom House. Her death consumes Kenzie--he is convinced that someone pulled her into the vortex, although her nearest and dearest simply call her weak.Kenzie teams up with his explosive, loving, gun-toting friend Bubba Rogowski, and, after a boozy reunion, Angie Gennaro joins them. This fearless threesome must surely be the most original team in contemporary crime fiction. Good at the core--but seriously screwed up by various demons from their pasts--tact and decorum is hardly their style. They work their way across Boston, doing whatever it takes to question Nichols's family and acquaintances. By unveiling the real Nichols, tragic family secrets, betrayals, and conspiracies are also unmasked.If you haven't experienced Dennis Lehane's world before, be prepared for an invigorating new reading experience.--Naomi Gesinger--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Prayers for Rain", "price": 5.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 83041}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71hVD3yKgCL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061998869", "0061998850", "0061836958", "0061336211", "0062049100", "0061998842", "0061998877", "0062068407", "0062190946", "0062197754", "0062068415", "0061836923", "B007BWD5SY", "0061139718", "1933354917", "0060584750", "0062365444", "006117226X", "0062224042", "0060004878", "0062224034", "0553818260", "0061886041", "0062249908", "0688143814", "0688153321", "1476764018", "006230559X", "1416514988", "0425245721", "0425238121", "0399162380", "042526131X", "0804178747", "0425264696", "045141411X", "1455575992", "1455526959", "0553286447", "0142181315", "0345451910", "0553565095", "0425267768", "0399162372", "0446611646", "1477818162", "0345451902", "0345807154", "006113967X", "0553275852", "0451417283", "0446561959", "0425227987", "0446556696", "0553299514", "0786889055", "034543448X", "0446582778", "0345535154", "0515153702", "1439128316", "0399161589", "1477819754", "0525953493", "0515154644", "0451180429", "B009WIY7RI", "0688163173", "0316069515", "0385344341", "0446616443", "0380713608", "0399159304", "1476762066", "0440246326", "1455550620", "0399169113", "1455550639", "0399161481", "0688163165", "0425250598", "0525954600", "0446556726", "0765369133", "0425183769", "1416548505", "0446401307", "B007CKXYTA", "042518546X", "1455550671", "0312946511", "0345530578", "1616148772", "0440224047", "0440246318", "1416513450", "1455550612", "0345434471", "0770435564", "0425178765"], "bought_together": ["0061998869", "0061998850"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061998850", "0062049100", "0061998869", "0062197754"]}}

However, they forget all about him when a spaceship lands in the backyard, bearing a friendly family of antennaed aliens, a cool robot, and the family pet (sort of a cross between an elephant and a caterpillar). The pups and aliens spend a splendid afternoon together, sharing a picnic lunch, a rousing game of \"zlammaroo,\" and a dip in the portable force-field pool. When the aliens' father discovers that the spaceship was damaged in the landing, Zoomer gives up his beloved tricycle so the space family can get home in time for Christmas. His kindness does not go unnoticed by Santa, and he is appropriately rewarded.

{"asin": "0061996343", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this series starter, a companion to the wildly popular Seeker books, Hunter picks up after the death of the bear Ujurak in an avalanche. The remaining three bears, mourning the loss of their friend, begin the long journey home. Toklo, a brown bear; Lusa, a small black bear; and Kallik, a polar bear are accompanied by Yakone, another polar bear they met on Star Island. Toklo, in particular, misses his friend and is grumpy and difficult. Ujurak, now a starbear, appears to Lusa and Kallik in dreams, encouraging them to &#x201C;remember what matters most.&#x201D; The bears encounter great hardship, making their way eventually onto a large island where they encounter a young bear who was driven out by his family. Toklo, sure that the cub has been sent by Ujurak, is determined to protect him. Nanulak&#x2019;s parents are a polar bear and a brown bear, and the young bear is deeply angry over his &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; status, bringing intense discord to the group that threatens to divide them completely. The bears&#x2019; journey has only just begun, and clearly there will be many more volumes. Reflecting the realities of the natural world, this new adventure will be greeted with delight by fans of the series.       HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Extensive marketing efforts, including companion websites, social media outreach, and online games, will likely expand the already vast fan base for Hunter&#x2019;s series.

{"asin": "0061996521", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Oates's latest collection explores certain favorite Oatesian themes, primary among them violence, loss, and privilege. Three of the stories feature white, upper-class, educated widows whose sheltered married lives have left them unprepared for life alone. In \"Pumpkin-Head\" and \"Sourland,\" the widows--Hadley in the first story, Sophie in the second--encounter a class of Oatesian male: predatory, needy lurkers just out of prosperity's reach. In the first story, our lurker is Anton Kruppe, a Central European immigrant and vague acquaintance of Hadley whose frustrations boil over in a disastrous way. In the second story, Sophie is contacted by Jeremiah, an old friend of her late husband, and eventually visits him in middle-of-nowhere northern Minnesota, where she discovers, too late, his true intentions. The third widow story, \"Probate,\" concerns Adrienne Myer's surreal visit to the courthouse to register her late husband's will, but Oates has other plans for Adrienne, who is soon lost in a warped bureaucratic funhouse worthy of Kafka. Oates's fiction has the curious, morbid draw of a flaming car wreck. It's a testament to Oates's talent that she can nearly always force the reader to look.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Uprooted from his middle-class world by his parents so that his mother can pursue an acting career, he now lives with them in an upscale section of California, drives a BMW, and attends a prep school. Being the odd man out intensifies when on Jeff's first day he encounters none other than Kimberlee Schaffer. Unfortunately for him, she is dead and he is the only one who can see or hear her. His agreeing to help Kimberlee with her \"unfinished business\" begins a whirlwind adventure full of secrets, lies, unlikely friendships, romance, and important lessons about the price of redemption. Pike delivers an insightfully written, fast-paced, and witty plot told from a teenage boy's point of view. Full of well-developed characters, this ghostly tale tackles complicated themes such as acceptance, bullying, and atonement that readers will relate to.

But  it isn't the plant that finishes off Alice Rogers; the lively, free-spirited widow is murdered by someone who injects her as she lies writhing in pain. Now Joanna has to find out whether anyone in Alice's large family would have  killed her for her land and money. Was it her son Cletus, \"a restaurateur with the diplomacy of a mountain goat,\" who was recently elected mayor of the legendary Arizona town of Tombstone (where Wyatt Earp once reigned)?

{"asin": "0061999660", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 7 Up-An updated version of Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. Jack is separated from his girlfriend by her disapproving father, who arranges a summer job for the boy babysitting two orphaned children, Miles and Flora, on an isolated island. The story is narrated by Jack in a series of letters to Sophie that relate the increasingly odd happenings: people appear that no one else can see, Jack hears vague rumors of a strange death on the island last year, and the two children appear to be hiding secrets of their own. From the housekeeper, Jack learns of the previous nanny, Lucy, and her lover, Norris-now deceased-whose ghosts may be haunting the area. Prose includes all the elements of the Gothic ghost story as she masterfully establishes a brooding, dark tone: a cavernous mansion, a mysteriously locked room, eerily well-behaved children. At times, the epistolary format stretches credulity (such as Jack still writing after he breaks up with Sophie). However, letters that end on cliff-hangers heighten the suspense and keep the narrative moving at a breakneck pace. Though the ambiguous conclusion is spooky, readers will likely find the twist at the end of Adele Griffin's Tighter (Knopf, 2011), based on the same source material, far more satisfying. As with James's original story, Prose effectively establishes the protagonist as an unreliable narrator, though the voice of Griffin's wayward teenager is more convincing. Still, this is a gripping page-turner that even reluctant readers will have trouble putting down.-Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Beaumont, hard-drinking detective. When he checks into an alcohol and drug rehabilitation center in rural Arizona, the bad-tempered Beaumont is paired with an annoying roommate, Joey Rothman, who sneaks out after curfew to deal drugs and seduce girls. After spying his own visiting teenaged daughter smooching with Joey, Beaumont waits up for him with fists bared, joined by the irate father of a young patient whom Joey has impregnated. When Joey's body is found hanging from a tree, apparently plugged dead with Beaumont's gun, the police peg Beaumont along with the pregnant girl's father as their prime suspects. The two men team up with Joey's mother to find the killer. Beaumont, throughout, spouts cliches: \"Her look of utter abandonment sliced through my heart like a hot knife.\" Despite a few dramatic mountainside car chases and fights with machine-gun-toting drug thugs, Jance's plot is plodding, disjointed and predictable.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Minor in Possession: A J.P.

{"asin": "0061999180", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Product DescriptionAfter a layoff and months of struggling, Alice Humphrey finally lands her dream job managing a new art gallery in Manhattan&rsquo;s trendy Meatpacking District.According to Drew Campbell, the well-suited corporate representative who hires her, the gallery is a passion project for its anonymous, wealthy, and eccentric owner. Drew assures Alice that the owner will be hands off, allowing her to run the gallery on her own. Her friends think it sounds too good to be true, but Alice sees a perfect opportunity to make a name for herself beyond the shadow of her famous father, an award-winning and controversial film maker.Everything is perfect until the morning Alice arrives at work to find the gallery gone&mdash;the space stripped bare as if it had never existed&mdash;and Drew Campbell&rsquo;s dead body on the floor. Overnight, Alice&rsquo;s dream job has vanished, and she finds herself at the center of police attention with nothing to prove her innocence. The phone number Drew gave her links back to a disposable phone.The artist whose work she displayed doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. And the dead man she claims is Drew has been identified as someone else.When police discover ties between the gallery and a missing girl, Alice knows she&rsquo;s been set up. Now she has to prove it&mdash;a dangerous search for answers that will entangle her in a dark, high-tech criminal conspiracy and force her to unearth long-hidden secrets involving her own family&hellip; secrets that could cost Alice her life.Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly ReviewsLong GoneMichael Connelly&rsquo;s Edgar Award-winning first novel,The Black Echo, was published in 1992 and based in part on a true crime that had occurred in Los Angeles. Since then he has written more than 18 novels, the most recent of which isThe Fifth Witness.You know how the song goes--&ldquo;If I can make it here, I&rsquo;ll make it anywhere.&rdquo; The anthem for a city and a state of mind, powered by the voice of its own son, Frank Sinatra, even if technically he came from across the river.New York, New York. It is truly the first song on the soundtrack of the city. And it points up the risk and reward of living in the greatest city in the world.Well, what about the risks and rewards in writing a novel about the greatest city in the world? To me the challenge would be intimidating, even daunting, before I got the first word down on the first page. But not to Alafair Burke. WithLong Goneshe makes the city her own. She takes New York with a knowing and confident hand, folding its teeming streets into character and plot in a story that is never less than gripping.At center you have Alice Humphrey. She is the daughter of privilege in a city that doesn&rsquo;t pay much mind to that privilege. She&rsquo;s on her own and that is the beating heart of this book. Alice on her own. Burke constructs this book with the precision of a watchmaker. It is a contraption piece that closes tightly around Alice and then we are with her as she investigates the set up and finds her way to safety.I am familiar with most of Burke&rsquo;s work and I think Alice is her best heroine yet. She connects with us on so many levels. She is an everywoman cornered by forces she doesn&rsquo;t recognize or understand in a city with too many back alleys and secrets to ever know.  She is from a family that holds secrets from her as well as the world. But no matter. She is relentless in her pursuit of the truth, whichever way it is finally told. And in that we connect to her, admire her, like her. We feel for Alice Humphrey and want to be there when she sees it all through.That is the writer&rsquo;s most difficult task, building the bridge of empathy between reader and protagonist. Burke does it here with a character who is persistent in simply refusing to be a victim. Don&rsquo;t we all wish we were the same.Though any writer will flat out tell you that the easier it looks the harder it is to get on the page, Alafair Burke makes this one look like a walk in the park. Frank Sinatra would certainly be proud.

{"asin": "0062001043", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* In the half-magical world of Eathesbury, Azalea is the oldest of 12 daughters and heir to her father&#xFFFD;s throne. When the sisters&#xFFFD; mother dies after a long illness, the siblings find a hidden passageway to an enchanted pavilion under the castle where they can dance all night, secretly breaking the rules of mourning. The mysterious and alluring Keeper makes this possible, but he also seems to have less-than-honorable plans for the girls, especially Azalea. The tale&#xFFFD;s atmosphere becomes increasingly dark and brooding as the truth from ages past comes out, and Azalea realizes just what evil they are pitted against. With several unexpected twists, the story, based on the original Grimms&#xFFFD; tale &#xFFFD;The Worn-Out Dancing Shoes,&#xFFFD; plunges toward a harrowing conclusion. This first novel is richly imagined with a gothic feel, and Dixon&#xFFFD;s descriptions of the many dances are thrilling. Although the general story line will be familiar to readers of Jessica Day George&#xFFFD;s Princess of the Midnight Ball (2009), this romantic fantasy is darker in tone, and the villain resembles the faeries in Nancy Werlin&#xFFFD;s Impossible (2008) and O. R. Melling&#xFFFD;s The Hunter&#xFFFD;s Moon (2005). The story gracefully explores significant themes of grief and loss, mercy and love. Full of mystery, lush settings, and fully orbed characters, Dixon&#xFFFD;s debut is both suspenseful and rewarding.

{"asin": "0061998982", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A missing teenager and an octogenarian found dead of apparently natural causes are pretty run-of-the-mill cases in Bisbee, Arizona, where Sheriff Joanna Brady is focusing on the last-minute details of her upcoming wedding.   In this latest outing in Judith Jance's Brady series, the connection between the two  events is a thin one. In the author's capable hands, however, it's enough to  drive this well-plotted mystery to a credible conclusion.Fifteen-year-old Lucy Ridder dreads her mother's release from prison, eight  years after she was convicted of killing Lucy's beloved father. Lucy is aware  that her mother's priority is not a family reunion but the  retrieval of a mysterious diskette entrusted to Lucy by her dad shortly before  his death. After inadvertently witnessing her mother's brutal slaying by a stranger who's also hot after the diskette, Lucy vanishes.  It takes most of the novel for Joanna to figure out that Lucy's  disappearance is tied to her mother's murder, and for good reasons. Besides the  distraction of her pending nuptials, the sheriff has been accused of killing her  elderly, beloved neighbor for financial gain. Because the reader knows the truth  of both situations very early in the game, Joanna's delayed awareness doesn't pack as much wallop as it might. The greater mystery is whether she'll strangle her wedding-obsessed mother before she and her too-good-to-be-true fianc&eacute; make it to the altar.--Jane Adams--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Devil's Claw (Joanna Brady Mysteries)", "price": 8.54, "salesRank": {"Books": 265538}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61oyPpx4l7L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061998974", "0062088130", "0061998966", "0061998958", "0060540915", "0062088157", "0061774790", "0061774804", "0061774596", "0061774618", "006196171X", "0060746785", "0061239232", "006173280X", "0062366920", "0062294822", "0061958522", "0061958530", "0062086391", "0062086367", "0061999288", "1416537740", "0061958514", "0061999318", "0062086405", "0061958549", "0062086413", "0061999296", "0380724359", "0061731323", "006199930X", "0062086383", "0062088122", "1416537732", "0062088165", "0060540931", "0061958557", "141656635X", "1451628609", "1416566368", "0062134701", "1416566376", "0061731161", "1451628692", "0061945382", "0061945374", "1476745005", "B0073PBFUO", "0061945390", "B008SLG3QS", "B000TMM96W", "0060746769", "B00EJ0Q35S", "0062134671", "038097729X", "006213468X", "0061239224", "B0073P8LZG", "B005Q872ZW", "0380977303", "0380973952", "0688138217", "0061774774", "0060540907", "B000NSFVAS", "0380974991", "B0073PBGY4", "0380975009", "0380973944", "0062326422", "B0073PBJZK", "0345543858", "0380974061", "0553588079", "B004HMYOMW", "0553588087", "0425155188", "0553591916", "0515122491", "0399157344", "0062128388", "0515128600", "0553591924", "0380977311", "0553584537", "0399164448", "0345505751", "1416563814", "1451628587", "0399169113", "0425195449", "0451466861", "0345542924", "0060787201", "0345505700", "0727884158", "0425148297", "0451418360", "0804178747", "0425150984"], "bought_together": ["0062088130", "0061998974"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061998958", "006173280X", "0061774804", "0061998974"]}}

{"asin": "0061999407", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Librarian Jacqueline Kirby, wanting a tax-deductible excuse to vacation in New York City (and to leave the small town in Nebraska where she works at a small college), poses as a romance author in order to attend a historical romance writers conference in the Big Apple. She is soon caught up in masquerades, intrigues, and deadly goings-on. This light mystery with intriguing characters is capably narrated by Liza Ross, who produces a range of credible voices for persons both male and female, several with discernible regional accents. Jacqueline's wry tone is matched by Ross's light, never-too-serious inflection, making for a very pleasant listening experience.

{"asin": "0061998818", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "From the seasoned perspective of her eighty-nine years, Agathe, the eldest von Trapp family daughter paints a rose-hued portrait of life before and after the highly fictionalized Broadway and Hollywood account of her famous family&#x2019;s story. Though diehard Sound of Music fans may be disappointed to learn that the von Trapps&#x2019; &#x201C;escape&#x201D; from Austria&#x2014;they simply boarded a train to Italy&#x2014;was much less dramatic than the memorable Technicolor climb over the mountains depicted in the movie, their hearts will still be blessed with the sound of music that resonates throughout the pages of this charming, family-friendly memoir. Agathe dishes no dirt; in fact, her recollections of her beloved Mam&#xE1;, Pap&#xE1;, stepmother, and fairy-tale-like childhood in Austria, are all refreshingly positive and upbeat. A gentle patriarch, unlike the strict disciplinarian portrayed in both the stage and film versions, Georg von Trapp, oversaw the musical education of all his children after the death of his first wife. After immigrating to the U.S. and embarking on their collective musical career as the Trapp Family Singers, the close-knit bonds forged in their Tyrolean childhoods never frayed. Though less fantastical, Agathe&#x2019;s homespun recollections, illustrated with her own sketches and family photos, is a must-read for diehard Sound of Music fans. Sugar-sweet but never saccharine. --Margaret Flanagan", "title": "Memories Before and After the Sound of Music: An Autobiography", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 211966}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5153x80EK3L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0060005777", "0892216964", "1890757004", "0140298401", "155783847X", "B002HMHRL4", "0803213506", "B000QCQUCE", "B002DYJKHU", "B000NSI9LQ", "1585365319", "0670889083", "B0007DMT4A", "0803246676", "030746119X", "B000VPVJ1S", "1416549544", "0809238373", "0892215011", "1423490797", "B003VS0CX8", "B0007DN1E2", "B00FWMVVLS", "0380007835", "B0041GWWUK", "149428006X", "0547892624", "B00FGGN7LW", "1476762929", "0962798215", "0060885521", "006009026X", "0892210087", "0425177319", "0062213652", "0380411113", "1416936556", "B000URDCC6", "B0006CUS2W", "0062213660", "1476752990", "B0000AYLKK", "B000001VP1", "0312564988", "0670026093", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0152058168", "0385344961", "0545399971", "0152060804", "B007REMLQ8", "1476726507", "0070055327", "0544217624", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00EJYGL8S"], "bought_together": ["0060005777", "0892216964"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060005777", "155783847X", "1890757004", "0892216964"]}}

{"asin": "0062002392", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 10 Up-This final installment in the trilogy opens with Ellie desperately trying to save her beloved angelic guardian, Will, from the only poison that can affect him: demonic reaper's venom. The resolute heroine teams up with Cadan, the third side of Ellie's love triangle and half brother to Will, to heal Will before the trio sets off to travel the world and hunt down the one relic that will enable Ellie, actually the archangel Gabriel reincarnated as a human teen, to stop the apocalypse. Throughout the series, Ellie is torn between protecting her loved ones, trying to live a normal teenager's life, and playing the role of Preliator in the constant battle against evil. Moulton successfully builds Ellie and Will's star-crossed love to a memorable status; they are perfect for one another, yet the fates are hostile. But Ellie's two worlds do not merge seamlessly. In an attempt to tie up loose ends, the author concludes this Bible-based fantasy series with an odd science-fiction spin that isn't quite effective.

In the new story, the family is home in England from their archeological dig in Egypt and deep in another mystery. Determined Victorian feminist Peabody refuses to be intimidated by a phenomenon reported at the British Museum, where a sem priest is supposedly working a curse in revenge for the desecration of an ancient mummy. The priest's supernatural figure is momentarily glimpsed at the exhibit, before a murderer strikes. Disobeying Emerson, of course, Peabody lays her life on the line and unmasks the decidedly human villain. There are several intriguing new characters in this mystery, including nasty types who persecute Ramses, creating unexpectedly tender moments between mother and child. But the spotlight shines brightest on Peabody and Emerson, a couple evenly matched as hot-blooded lovers and professional partners. This is one of grandmaster Peters/Michaels best.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Deeds of the Disturber (Amelia Peabody Mysteries)", "price": 8.63, "salesRank": {"Books": 119597}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GktEdPa9L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061999210", "0061999202", "0061951633", "0061951641", "006195165X", "0061999237", "1455572373", "1455572381", "1455572365", "145557239X", "1455572403", "1455572357", "0061951668", "0061246271", "0061032484", "0061999385", "0060591811", "006059179X", "0060538112", "044651585X", "0061656070", "0061429791", "1845293878", "0062087797", "0061999393", "0446518336", "0061656097", "0446514837", "0061656100", "0062087800", "0061246263", "1845293886", "0061656089", "1845295552", "1845293894", "0446518344", "0446602485", "0061246255", "B0072Q237S", "0380976579", "B007HWOR1W", "0062087789", "0380976587", "1566190355", "0061429783", "0066214718", "0060591781", "0380978857", "0380976595", "0449215237", "0449208281", "0061999407", "1845295560", "B007CGUZS2", "0062119745", "0062119729", "B007SN4G34", "0060828692", "0345530500", "0066214769", "0380978849", "0812507606", "B0072AX7NI", "0061945730", "0684815028", "0061727717", "0062119710", "0345513975", "0486473627", "0061247839", "0060828862", "0060878142", "0060533331", "0061252778", "0449209121", "0060591803", "0061249645", "006219657X", "0062049585", "0062087827", "0380731223", "0312429258", "0312428189", "0345536746", "1476724024", "1845295579", "0449209830", "0449208672", "1250021405", "0684803860", "0062196537", "0312426852", "0449006700", "B003IWYIZA", "0684006316", "0061727687", "0345542924", "1455525839"], "bought_together": ["0061999210", "0061999202"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061999210", "0060538112", "0061999202", "0061999237"]}}

{"asin": "0061999245", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Like the series it inspired, Kellerman's award-winning 1986 debut novel combines police procedure, via hard-boiled LAPD detective Peter Decker, with Judaic rites and rituals courtesy of its heroine Rina Lazarus, an ultra-Orthodox widowed mother of two. Decker and Lazarus are brought together by the brutal rape of a young bride-to-be at the mikvah (a bathhouse used in the purification ritual) that Rina manages in the Hollywood hills. Mitchell Greenberg nicely vocalizes the story from Decker's point of view, with the detective struggling to stick to his sleuthing in spite of his developing feelings for Rina. The novel continually rings true, from explaining various Orthodox beliefs and customs to Decker and his crew's no-nonsense unmasking of the villain. Greenberg moves in and out of the novel's elements smoothly and efficiently. He paces the police work with just the right sense of urgency and frustration; handles the romantic sequences with the proper emotion and without a hint of sentimentality; and breezes through the many Jewish-centric passages with the confidence and clarity of a yeshiva graduate.An Avon paperback.

{"asin": "0062000675", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* In 2009, Laura Ling, a reporter with Current TV, traveled with a film crew to the region of China that bordered on North Korea to report on defections, particularly of women who were later forced into arranged marriages or sex slavery. The crew momentarily crossed into North Korea, and Ling and Euna Lee, her editor and translator, were captured. Given the hostilities between North Korea and China and a recent critical documentary on North Korea by Laura&#x2019;s sister, journalist Lisa Ling, the women knew they were in for an ordeal. Laura was beaten during the capture, and the women were held in isolation and faced meager meals, cold, and little medical treatment. In the U.S., Lisa and her family prayed and called on powerful contacts, including Al Gore and Bill Richardson, to win the women&#x2019;s release. During the time of their captivity, North Korea conducted a nuclear test and fired off missiles, increasing tensions with the U.S. and UN. The women were eventually tried for attempting to overthrow the government and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp, but through behind-the-scenes maneuvering and negotiations with prickly North Korea, they were finally released after five months in captivity. This memoir alternates between the sisters, with Laura recalling the escalating peril of her capture and imprisonment and Lisa recalling heightened worries as weeks dragged into months. A riveting story of captivity and the enduring faith, determination, and love of two sisters. --Vanessa Bush", "title": "Somewhere Inside: One Sister's Captivity in North Korea and the Other's Fight to Bring Her Home", "price": 10.23, "salesRank": {"Books": 631963}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l1yblmypL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008SLOKKY", "0465011047", "0349118655", "0385523912", "1594036330", "157322989X", "0792241843", "0143122916", "0670023329", "B000AM6OA8", "0393704122", "157230457X", "0976550814", "0882643355", "1931368252", "0231147465", "0615678351", "B0029PEV36", "0520253337", "0742567052", "0307589676", "1451673310", "0742567184", "1937592189", "0901644250"], "bought_together": ["B008SLOKKY", "0385523912"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0143122916", "0385523912", "0349118655", "B008SLOKKY"]}}
{"asin": "0061999857", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "When Sankovitch lost her older sister to cancer, she was determined to \"live her life double\" in order to make up for her family's painful loss. But after three years spent at a frenetic pace, Sankovitch decided to slow down and rediscover the pleasure of books in order to reconnect with the memory of her sister. Despite the day-to-day responsibilities of raising four sons&mdash;and the holidays, vacations, and sudden illnesses that accompany a large family&mdash;Sankovitch vowed to read one book a day for an entire year and blog about it. In this entertaining bibliophile's dream, Sankovitch (who launched ReadAllDay.org and was profiled in the New York Times) found that her \"year of magical reading\" was \"not a way to rid myself of sorrow but a way to absorb it.\" As well as being an homage to her sister and their family of readers, Sankovitch's memoir speaks to the power that books can have over our daily lives. Sankovitch champions the act of reading not as an indulgence but as a necessity, and will make the perfect gift from one bookworm to another. (June)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Mac is a problem solver, Vince is a whiz at keeping track of the money and favors they earn, and both boys are avid Chicago Cubs fans. Their &#xFFFD;office&#xFFFD; is located in an underused school bathroom, hence this first novel&#xFFFD;s title. The business takes a beating&#xFFFD;and then so does the boys&#xFFFD; friendship&#xFFFD;when an older kid applies muscle to the threats he has made to grade-schoolers who owe gambling debts. Rylander has created a cast of memorable and varied characters, replete with emotional as well as social lives. Mac narrates the convoluted tale with the arch flatness of a 1940s satire of the noir detective genre, so swallowing even the more preposterous coincidences is easy for the sake of the story&#xFFFD;s fun.

{"asin": "006199975X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The writer was born in Seattle to an American farm girl and a Bedouin father, and he soon returned to Qatar, where he started a second family. As a young teen, Sophia is on the classic quest to find her father (and herself), and her wry, eloquent narrative does a great job of blending the viewpoints of the 12-year-old then and the adult writer now, while the intersection of contemporary cultures explodes the comfortable stereotypes, old and new. The girl is shocked by backward Bedouin traditions and deep sexual segregation, but she also remembers her American school segregation of jocks, geeks, and freaks, and very clearly by race, and she discovers that love in a culture of arranged marriage and sexual oppression can be &#x201C;far more complex than anything on MTV.&#x201D; As the action moves from the Nile delta to Cairo, her commentary gets it exactly right, and without a heavy message. The day was so full of these &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; people doing, well, &#x201C;normal&#x201D; stuff.

{"asin": "0061999768", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. Bryson (A Short History of Nearly Everything) presents a remarkable collection of essays celebrating the 350th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Society of London and its many contributions to science. Society members have included such illustrious names as Darwin, Newton, Leibniz, and Francis Bacon, to name a few. The volume's 23 contributors are both uniformly excellent and remarkable for their diversity. For example, novelist Margaret Atwood writes a very personal piece about the image of the scientist and its sometime appearance as the \"mad scientist.\" Science historian Paul Davies writes about the effects on Western society of the realization that we are not the center of the universe. Biologist Richard Dawkins opines about the revolutionary nature of Darwin's discoveries, and science fiction writer Gregory Benford contemplates the meaning of time. The wide array of scientific disciplines, including genetics, climate change, physics, and engineering, are each placed in a fresh and thought-provoking social and historical context. Bryson's name will bring readers in, but the real reward is fine writers writing about serious science in an accessible, good-natured style. It is a worthy celebration of the Royal Society.

Quickly but delightfully read, Maguire&#x2019;s new novel has as its canvas the entire little town of Thebes in Upstate New York. His natural compassion for people&#x2019;s quirks gives his razor-sharp satire on small-town life a comfortable bed on which to rest. Maguire looks backward in time, to the advent of the new millennium in 2000. His theme is that, at this significant historical moment, town characters, including the church-lady Leontina Scale and her profanity-spewing daughter and the gay choir director, now face having their personal choices being called into question but eventually seeing the disparate pieces of their lives reconciled. Amusing entertainment but with a serious side as well.

When Irma's&nbsp;mother dies, she warns her 16-year-old daughter that leaving their little Italian village dooms her to die among strangers. A few years later, Irma, frightened of her increasingly lustful father, leaves her village and, armed only with her sewing skills and a small dowry, secures passage on the Servia, where she meets the first in a series of helpful strangers who will color, shape, and add the occasional zest of danger (her face is scarred by the time she disembarks) to her journeys. In America, her friendships with a few determined women--Lula, an African-American cook; Molly, an Irish maid; and Sofia, an Italian nurse--help keep her afloat and moving from a Cleveland sweatshop, through misery and rejuvenation in Chicago, and, finally, to the lush hills in San Francisco. Though some plot turns are played too melodramatically, Irma's adventures and redeeming evolution make this a serious book club contender. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

{"asin": "0062001345", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Newton delivers a stirring debut novel told from the perspectives of four central characters embroiled in a family drama that spans generations and is riddled with defensive secrecy and emotional penury in equal measure. After the disappearance of Leon Owenby, his younger brother and central narrator, Martin, returns to the family's Willoby County, N.C., mountain town from his life as a destitute writer in New York City to aid in the search for Leon and support his other siblings. The year is 1986; Martin leaves behind his ex-lover, Dennis, and their many friends sick and dying from AIDS. Back home, he must face his painful past, his extended family to whom he is closeted, and his high school girlfriend (who still carries a torch for him). Many months of searching reveal more about the searchers than about Leon; the secrets and resentments in the Owenby family run deep and bubble to the surface unexpectedly. It's problematic that with so many family issues coming to light, Martin's sexuality is ignored and remains a secret, but Newton's use of multiple viewpoints and distinct voices is adept and lively, and helps to fill in the thin premise of Leon's disappearance. With many novels of this construction, a reader tends to favor one voice over the rest. Not so here; Newton delivers across the board with these characters, who run the gamut from perky to depressive, desperate to schizophrenic. (Jan.) (c)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Although Rocky&#x2019;s death affected his wife and daughters deeply, Delilah&#x2019;s eye for business has brought new success. When they find out that Delilah&#x2019;s Daughters has made it to the final round of a popular singing competition, they can&#x2019;t imagine how quickly the entire family&#x2019;s lives will turn upside down. A solo contract from a prestigious record label threatens to break up the group, and when new paramours and old lovers enter the equation, Delilah and her daughters have to figure out if the cost of success is truly worth the price. This sweetly tender story of one family&#x2019;s attempt to navigate the rocky waters of stardom focuses on the importance of loyalty, sacrifice, and second chances. Benson&#x2019;s intimate knowledge of the music industry is evident, and her charming, inspirational novel will appeal both to fans of Martha Southgate and loyal Behind the Music viewers. --Stephanie Turza", "title": "Delilah's Daughters: A Novel", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 1022343}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71d4x5d4KIL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0758205732", "0062207970", "1476748853", "1476747172", "0758280602", "1496155718", "1476714924", "1496125827", "1601627149", "1629110094", "1494905477", "0983893551", "1601627173", "0758286651", "1455526134", "1629110108", "1593095589", "1426749287", "1593094736", "149427874X", "1941342019", "1593095228", "0758274742", "0778316254", "0758281390", "1494415070", "1499642784", "0312643373", "0373863527", "1494300044", "1629110086", "0758290381", "B00HW3EI3I", "0373863411", "0983456046", "1601627777", "160162669X", "006223112X", "1939481155", "1497362679", "1491210591", "1601627114", "1601627742", "0373863705", "0373863632", "0373863500", "0373863543", "0988218046", "037386356X", "0758286546", "0615944949", "B00GOZ2LPM", "1497362946", "0989293505", "0988367955", "0373733003", "0758292961", "1601627157", "037386342X", "0988850974", "160162395X", "9769528765", "075828652X", "0373091524", "9769556629", "0373863519", "1601627750", "0373091540", "0373863497", "0373863454", "0373863535", "0373091508", "0979045851", "098885094X", "0373863586", "1601626673", "1490386785", "0373863438", "B004JZWVT0", "1939481015", "061591800X", "0373863446", "0758286562", "0758275137", "0373863357", "1595549986", "160162770X", "0373863322", "0373863349", "1493574701", "1601627726", "1489594035", "9769548634", "1601627580", "0988850982", "0758277253", "0615842070", "1593095031", "0310334039", "1585713333"], "bought_together": ["0758205732"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0758205732", "1601627173", "1601627149"]}}

After Lily Berry loses her mother, gets dumped by her boyfriend, and is fired, she finds in her passion for all things Jane Austen (Jane, indeed, is Lily's imaginary friend) an escape route: she travels to England to participate in a Jane Austen re-enacting festival. Full of enthusiasm&mdash;but not acting talent&mdash;Lily is not embraced by many of the Janeites, but this doesn't prevent her from meeting a charismatic actor, contending with an impossible roommate, and struggling with dark family secrets, all while trying to find the courage to be the protagonist of her own story. While Jones does a credible job of creating a heroine in transition, Lily's process of self-realization isn't nearly as involving as the subplots, which is quite unfortunate, considering how much time is devoted to sussing out her issues.

{"asin": "0062004638", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "After a mistake at her infertility clinic, Carolyn Savage learned she was carrying another couple&#x2019;s baby. In this memoir that belongs at the top of any truth-is-stranger-than-fiction list, she and her husband tell the tale of why they decided to go through with the pregnancy and deliver a healthy boy to the biological parents. (Basically, it&#x2019;s because of their religious beliefs.) The book, which shifts between Carolyn&#x2019;s and Sean&#x2019;s perspectives, would have been better had biological parents Shannon and Paul Morell contributed, too. From the beginning, Carolyn seems to resent Shannon for not being sufficiently appreciative, and even after she says she is giving up baby Logan with no strings attached, she is peeved that Shannon sends her the same birth announcement &#x201C;in the same way that she had announced him to her extended family and distant friends.&#x201D; Ultimately, the Morells bring Logan to meet the Savages, but it&#x2019;s unclear how often they will see each other. The story is compelling and well told, although the Savages come across as martyrs  more than saints. --Karen Springen", "title": "Inconceivable", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 460094}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516Z2X97%2B-L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1451610564", "1439153558", "1462504515", "0826101208", "044656429X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767908201", "B00A19TQA0", "1439153558", "0316159212"]}}

{"asin": "0062000357", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In Rai's first novel, a young rural Indian woman named Mamta is given in marriage to a man so vile that he sells her kidney to buy prostitutes and fund his gambling. When Mamta learns that he plans to sell her other kidney, killing her, she flees to her home village, where her indentured father and brother help her escape to a city in central India. Once there, she finds her way and sends money to her mother, who, realizing that Mamta has left her husband, disowns her. Her brother-in-law, Lokend, arrives in the city to run for office and is badly attacked by his rival's aide, prompting Mamta to care for him. They fall in love and start a new life, bringing them back to their village, families, and a more humane existence. Though beautifully written, the story of Mamta is overwhelmed by cruelty and brutality; details on Mamta's late reconciliation with her mother and the sanctuary that the two create for abused women are but cursorily addressed. Despite the depth of feeling and the final note of redemption, many readers will find Rai's debut relentlessly bleak. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Though Drummond grew up in Oklahoma, she never imagined she&#xFFFD;d end up there for good. After four years of college in Los Angeles, Drummond was only making a pit stop home before moving to Chicago. A chance encounter with a devastatingly masculine cowboy in a local bar changes everything. Though several months elapse before Marlboro Man calls her, the spark between them ignites as soon as they start dating. A rancher with deep roots in the land he works, Marlboro Man isn&#xFFFD;t going anywhere, which means Drummond has to decide whether, to be with him, she&#xFFFD;s willing to give up her dream of moving to Chicago. By the time Marlboro Man proposes, the decision is made, and Drummond prepares to marry the love of her life and discover what being a rancher&#xFFFD;s wife will entail. Charming and bright, Drummond&#xFFFD;s story will be an inspiration to those who despair of finding old-fashioned, lasting love. --Kristine Huntley--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Pioneer Woman: Black Heels to Tractor Wheels--a Love Story", "price": 8.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 13247}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aT4zt82YL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061658197", "0061997188", "0062225227", "0061996556", "0062219146", "0062219081", "0062297503", "0062219200", "0062219111", "B00GSCOBXQ", "0062219170", "0307381374", "0804139423", "0061996572", "0804186626", "1620931451", "1451679165", "1414385544", "1414375662", "0425260720", "160907324X", "0061724882", "0307465233", "0761174907", "1414371713", "1439190631", "1433681846", "0743269977", "0385346050", "0470906022", "0770435009", "0307464873", "0143124722", "0778316440", "0345546881", "B00005RRG7", "B00G0X49VW", "B001FB6IFY", "0425259854", "0425259870"], "bought_together": ["0061658197", "0061997188"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061997188", "0061658197", "0062225227", "0804139423"]}}
{"asin": "0062004964", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 4-7&#x2013;This intricately plotted, appealing continuation of the classic tale combines magic, realism, and some modern attitudes. Queen Rosamond and her husband have lived with the terror of a curse put upon her as an infant and on her future firstborn child. The original curse foretold the queen's death at the age of 16, but Emmeline, her father's godmother, lessened it. Instead, Rosamond slept for a century after pricking her finger. The same curse is now on Princess Aurora, so her parents have sheltered their daughters from the outside world. Twelve-year-old Aurora is obedient and proper, whereas her younger sister, Luna, is far more curious and independent. The girls have no knowledge of the curse until Luna cuts her finger on a piece of glass. When the queen sees this she faints, and it is then that the girls must be told the truth. Though all sharp objects have been removed from the palace, a quill pen finds its way there in the bag of the girls' new tutor, and Aurora pricks her finger. Almost immediately sleepiness overwhelms her, and Luna devotes herself to keeping Aurora awake. Now they must survive horrendous obstacles as they search for Emmeline in the hope that she can undo or alter the curse. The girls are aided on their harrowing adventures by Symon, a young courageous fisherman, and eventually by their uncle, who has become a lutin, another creature with magical powers. Zahler's fans and those who enjoyed Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted (HarperCollins, 1997) or Robin McKinley's Beauty (HarperCollins, 1978) will love this story.&#x2013;Renee Steinberg, formerly at Fieldstone Middle School, Montvale, NJ&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

{"asin": "006199605X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. Pittard leads the reader into a slew of possibilities spinning out from a 16-year-old girl's disappearance, in her intriguing, beguiling debut. After Nora Lindell goes missing on Halloween, stories about her disappearance multiply: she got into a car with an unknown man, she was seen at the airport, she simply walked away, she was abducted. Pittard dips into the points-of-view of various classmates to explore these possibilities and more. Perhaps Nora was murdered. One theory sends her to Arizona, where she raises twin daughters with a lover named Mundo, and another path leads her to a near-death experience in a cafe bombing in India. The story also outlines effects of the disappearance on Nora's family and classmates, who, even as they graduate, marry, and have children, never quite let go of Nora&mdash;possibly to avoid their own lives. Though the truth about Nora remains tantalizingly elusive&mdash;the reader is never quite sure what happened&mdash;the many possibilities are so captivating, and Pittard's prose so eloquent, that there's a far richer experience to be had in the chain of maybes and what-ifs than in nailing down the truth.

{"asin": "0062005596", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "With the straight-ahead timing and the ethereal blowing of a great jazzman, Crouch delivers a scorching set in this first of two volumes of his biography of Charlie Yardbird Parker, capturing the downbeats and the up-tempo moments of the great saxophonist's life and music. Drawing on interviews with numerous friends, fellow musicians, and family members, Crouch traces Parker's life from his earliest days in Kansas City, Mo., his early romance and eventual marriage to Rebecca Ruffin, and his heroin addiction to his involvement with his mentors Lester Young and Buster Smith. Crouch brings to life the swinging backdrop against which Parker honed his craft: Kansas City was becoming a kind of kind of experimental laboratory, where the collective possibilities of American rhythm were being refined and expanded on a nightly basis. Parker eventually decides that Kansas City isn't big enough for him, and he rides the rails to Chicago and New York, ending up on Buster Smith's doorstep, eager to absorb all the lessons the big city has to teach him. By now, he had long since mastered the physical challenges of playing... and become preoccupied with the coordination of mind and muscle necessary to make his own way. As Crouch reminds us, however, Charlie Parker, no matter how highly talented, was not greater than his idiom. But his work helped to lead the art form to its most penetrating achievement.

The Wild Poppy is a renegade who rescues enslaved aristos from the clutches of revolutionaries-or is he? In truth, they are one and the same. The novel follows the adventures of Persis and \"the league\" as they attempt to right the wrongs inflicted by Galatean revolutionaries upon society. Persis might have carried on at the same pace-socialite by day, spy by night-if her path hadn't crossed with Justen's. He is grandson to the famous Persistence Helo, inventor of a treatment that saved many from suffering \"reduction,\" but also proved to have unintended side effects. Once Justen enters Persis's life, seemingly remorseful for the dark direction taken by his people and ready to make things right, she is unsure if she can trust him. As she wrestles with her simultaneous distrust and growing admiration for him, all the while continuing her mission as the Wild Poppy, adventure and intrigue unfold. Persis's well-drawn world is one of genetically engineered pets and communication methods called palmports that require users to take supplements to sustain their functionality. It provides the backdrop for a well-paced story led by a strong and likable heroine. Readers will relish its tender moments, especially one shared by Persis and Justen in a star-swept cove, as much as its abundant moments of suspense.-Jill Heritage Maza, Montclair Kimberley Academy, Montclair, NJ&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

{"asin": "0062005960", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* When legendary naturalist John Muir began exploring Glacier Bay in 1879, he was unprepared for &#xFFFD;the sheer poetic depth of the Alaskan wilderness.&#xFFFD; Twenty years later, Muir joined the Harriman Expedition, which found Alaska to be &#xFFFD;a unique, untrammeled, sui generis wilderness in need of preservation.&#xFFFD; Indeed, as soon as the U.S. acquired this magnificent and bountiful land, the war began between those who would recklessly exploit Alaska&#xFFFD;s natural wealth for profit and those who believed that this was a sacred place to be cherished and protected. Brinkley&#xFFFD;s scrupulous, dramatic chronicle of the complex struggle to protect Alaska&#xFFFD;s glorious wilderness and wildlife in the years before it became a state is the second book in what he describes as his lifework, a multivolume history of conservation in America that began with his unique portrait of Theodore Roosevelt, The Wilderness Warrior (2009). Here Roosevelt is one of many colorful visionaries Brinkley vividly portrays, from explorers and scientists (Charles Sheldon, William T. Hornaday) to artists and writers (Rockwell Kent, Walt Disney, Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder) to heroes Olaus and Mardy Murie, who campaigned tirelessly for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. Essential to understanding today&#xFFFD;s environmental challenges, Brinkley&#xFFFD;s Alaskan history and pantheon of valiant conservationists is boldly original, enlightening, enthralling, and profoundly moving.

Rosa Alcantara, 18, has learned to deal with her ability to shape-shift into a snake. With the death of her sister and aunt, she finds herself the head of her Italian Mafia family, and she must constantly guard against those who are looking to overthrow her for money or other personal gain. She finds it difficult to maintain her relationship with handsome Alessandro Carnevare. His relatives are also shape-shifters, but they are panthers and longtime enemies of her family. As Rosa rises to power, she uncovers a secret that her father had kept-an old conspiracy known as the TABULA, which threatens to destroy the Alcantara and the Carnevare clans. Both teens scramble to protect their families even though it might mean that they can't be together. The combination of supernatural elements, the Mafia, and forbidden love makes the story line unique and complex.

From Anubis and Zeus to Capt. James T. Kirk and Godzilla, Thompson delivers detailed and adrenaline-fueled screeds on 40 characters \"whose stories of ball-crushing conquest are still awesome enough to make even the tamest readers want to snatch up a sword and go hunting for dragon meat.\" Subjects include El Chupacabra (\"this freakadelic ass-reaming spawn of Satan\"); Diomedes (\"the wanton slaughter of faceless jobbers is just the beginning of  awesomeness\"); and, in a long-overdue tribute, the Daleks from Doctor Who (\"these murderous, automated salt-shakers are vile constructs of pure evil\"). Fortunately, the book includes badass women as well as men, and Thompson's overheated prose rises even further when describing the Indian goddess Kali: \"When she's not consuming the entrails of the gods, getting drunk on human blood, performing her Dance of Annihilation... she shoots blood out of her mouth like a fire hose... she's pretty much the most totally metal being ever.\" (Mar.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

They must locate and guard the gateway to the Abyss, protecting Earth from the monsters that would otherwise overrun it. Some of the gods of Greek mythology are lined up against them, while others lend them support. Before the sisters look for the gateway, they must rescue Euryale and Sthenno, Medusa's sisters, who can mentor them as they learn to wield their powers. They also plan to seek out their biological mother who gave them up for adoption as babies. Will she be able to answer their many questions? This book concludes the \"Sweet Venom\" trilogy with an action-packed climax and triumphant resolution for the three girls, their families, and their boyfriends. Character development is not a strong point, but readers looking for plenty of action and a new take on mythology will enjoy this series. Purchase this volume where the first two books have proven popular, as readers unfamiliar with the series will find this a confusing place to start.&#x2014;Misti Tidman, Licking County Library, Newark, OH", "title": "Sweet Legacy (Sweet Venom)", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 429707}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41983AmIluL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062001833", "0062001841", "B00A1ABLZM", "0062001825", "0062192086", "B00CNKXGQA", "0805092676", "0373210914", "1250003334", "1423165993", "0061914673", "0062135929", "1402289421", "0312642970", "0545424941", "0373210779", "1419709712", "1619630621", "0451414276", "0385742495", "0373211120", "0062265970", "1423146727", "1442493151", "0373210671", "1250039606", "0062059963", "0062117203", "0062012037", "1423176375", "0547813376", "0805092528", "0399256776", "1595143203", "0062059998", "0373210752", "1619633612", "0142414204", "0316213101", "0062072099", "1423175123", "0062048686", "0062070436", "006207119X", "1442430028", "0061974617", "1402294603", "1442445629", "0312594437", "1442416890", "0758281528", "1499104987", "0805092668", "080509461X", "B00A3ZQ4UW", "0062026542", "0316370312", "0399164227", "1250024633", "140227131X", "006202406X", "0316134074", "1595143211", "0062014552", "149609946X", "1937053571", "0062233653", "0805094601", "0803738897", "1423157516", "0761463275", "1940431042", "1442450371", "0062070460", "1423171020", "1250035910", "1423144341", "0373210450", "054537099X", "0062318322", "1250012899", "0375870466", "0758281498", "1595145931", "0061990698", "0062120298", "037321099X", "031621017X", "1250011914", "0525425926", "1423153286", "0670012092", "1622660757", "006202681X", "0545328136", "1423168232", "0373210558", "1416989846", "0312642962", "0373210698"], "bought_together": ["0062001833", "0062001825"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062001841", "B00A1ABLZM", "B00CNKXGQA", "0061914673"]}}

Good news: it's not only frustrating, it's been proven to be ineffective. While we all need a regular influx of breakthrough ideas, there's got to be a better way of sparking that creativity--and the brothers Coyne present a cogent way of doing it. They introduce readers to techniques for asking the right questions and sparking more powerful ideas. The concept underlying \"brainsteering\" is to encourage users to focus, to look into an idea deeply rather than ricocheting around, brainstorming-style. The Coynes present a number of real and proposed business cases, including successes like Forever Stamps and Jiffy Lube. Their logical thinking exercises will help readers to maximize their ideation skills, both by systematically exploring every possible nook and cranny of an issue to find new ideas, and by systematically evaluating and honing the results.

{"asin": "0062004166", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 7-10&ndash;Although magical T'&#xED;r na n'&#xD3;g remains unchanged, readers will find Ireland an unfamiliar place in this conclusion to the trilogy that began with The New Policeman (2007). In the not-too-distant future, global warming has wreaked havoc on the world's climate. Periods of unrelenting rain that have washed topsoil away and left crops rotting in the ground are followed by months of drought. People are starving, and there appears to be no hope. Aidan Liddy, whom readers last saw as a fractious toddler in The Last of the High Kings (2008, both HarperCollins), is now Commander Liddy. He has stockpiled food, tobacco, and other supplies, and uses his soldiers to control the suffering people. In an unexpected twist, Aidan's sensitive brother, Donal, now 69 years old, is his general. Although it appears that Donal has chosen an immoral path by following his brother, it becomes apparent that he has a plan to save the people and culture of Ireland, and fairyland will play an important role&ndash;if the Dagda and Aengus &#xD3;g will allow it. Thompson has done a marvelous job of spinning an entertaining and ultimately hopeful tale, while at the same time criticizing the devastation caused by humanity's excesses. And no book in this series would be complete without some music, so instead of a whimper, the end of this world comes with a wink and a nod, and an Irish tune.Heather M.

A year after sorority girl Nicole Werner died in a car accident, Nicole's boyfriend, Craig Clements-Rabbitt, who was driving, is trying to put his life together. When snobbish sophisticate Craig had arrived from New Hampshire at Godwin Honors Hall&mdash;a selective college within a huge Midwestern university&mdash;he soon got on the nerves of his more down-to-earth roommate, Perry Edwards, and Perry's childhood schoolmate, the beautiful Nicole. Now, Craig is a sober soul, but Nicole's former sorority sisters are unwilling to let her \"murderer\" be. Meanwhile, Shelly Lockes, the first witness at the accident scene, is hounded out of town, and Mira Polson, a professor of anthropology who looks too closely at Nicole's death, is forced to resign. Students commit suicide or are \"accidentally\" shot dead. If the narrative is convoluted, so is the diabolical, if improbable, scheme hatched by the sisters of Omega Theta Tau. Big Sister, apparently, watches over us all. (Mar.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Everyone in Sand's village knows that the castle, which is surrounded by an impenetrable thorn barrier, was damaged in an earthquake and isn't safe. As Sand begins to explore the ruins, he discovers that every object in the castle has been broken, and he begins to use his skills as an apprentice blacksmith to fix what he can. The protagonist is soon joined by Merlin the Falcon and Perrotte, the lost heir to the castle, who seems to have returned from death. Sand and Perrotte work together to repair the damage and gather the food and supplies they need to survive. They soon discover that their improvements seem to make the thorns that surround the castle disappear. Perrotte and Sand also come to understand their own and their families' pasts as they work toward forgiveness, facing their inner and outer conflicts. The developing relationship between the two main characters is portrayed realistically; it's often as prickly as the thorns that surround them. They both come of age as they accept themselves and those around them. Fans of Gail Carson Levine's and Shannon Hale's fairy tale adaptations will enjoy the adventure and mystery here.&#x2014;Beth L.

In the course of a few months, Julie has lost everything. Her grandmother died. Her mother lost her job, and subsequently their house. And Julie's been forced to move into a cramped two-bedroom apartment in a new school district while her mother goes through a midlife crisis that involves dating an aging metalhead. When she meets Clark, an enigmatic and peculiar senior, the two form an instant connection until Julie convinces him to help her contact her dead grandmother via an old Ouija board. Unfortunately, their misguided attempt has lasting and haunting repercussions when a malevolent ghost possesses Clark's body. Suddenly, the teens are running all over Los Angeles trying to find herbs and roses to cleanse Clark of this spirit before he's lost forever. Told in Block's signature, flowing prose, Teen Spirit is a layered story that's more about grief than it is about ghosts. Julie's narration is fast paced and accessible; readers won't be bogged down by intricate plots or complex ghost mythology. This is just a story about two kids learning to deal with loss. Julie realizes she cannot cling to the dead; she must hold her grandmother in her heart as she tries to live her own life. A beautiful story from a legendary young adult author.&#x2014;Kimberly Garnick Giarratano, Rockaway Township Public Library, NJ", "title": "Teen Spirit", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 413489}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iMxysSWEL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0805096272", "0805096310", "B00CVE11Y2", "1250033128", "0979420873", "B006OHUNP0", "0763662674", "0061452440", "0670012092", "125001980X", "0061926663", "0061565989", "1933149302", "1885865430", "006113094X", "0316134074", "B00IFFK5O8", "0142400378", "1250030951", "0062085573", "0062007408", "1442426705", "0312642970", "014240067X", "1595145141", "0064408329", "1442416890", "1594746125", "0763644064", "1451666179", "1250049377", "0066213673", "B0041T4NKE", "193314923X", "0061122874", "0061547875", "006135838X", "0061243434", "0060763841"], "bought_together": ["0805096272", "B00CVE11Y2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0805096272", "B00CVE11Y2", "0061566004", "B00BFQ909A"]}}

{"asin": "0062007521", "description": "The characters in these tidy stories navigate turbulent relationships with family members and romantic partners, many of whom vanish, as in the title story, about a daughter's struggles to reconcile her father's sudden desertion of their family. In \"The Weather,\" a teenage girl's new friend betrays her. \"And if there was one thing I knew,\" the narrator says, \"it was that this wouldn't get easier. It would ache for years.\" This lesson holds true for most of these stories, particularly in \"Remember, Relive,\" the second-person narrative of a young woman grappling with a traumatic past as her mother sinks into an Alzheimer's haze. Other stories have decidedly narrow focuses, as with \"The Separation,\" about an 11-year-old's relationship with her aloof older sister, or \"Escape,\" about a young widower's fledgling gambling addiction. Though the stories share themes and narrative tone, each stands firmly on its own, with Willis in full control as the characters face down their losses.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062009230", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The series of sketches that make up this memoir are arranged by the author/narrator's age, beginning with before her birth, when we see her parents meet in Japan. In bold, graphic black and white drawings, sometimes reminiscent of Marjane Satrapi, the author describes a frankly startling range of shenanigans in her early teenage years. These include long stints as a runaway and many sexual and romantic entanglements along the way. Never flinching from the down and dirty details of what went on with all these guys (and, eventually, girls), the author gives a refreshing and poignant look at early sexual experience and romance, including the actually dirty, the tragic, and the semisweet. Unfortunately, this \"r&eacute;sum&eacute;\" doesn't present in-depth exploration of the character holding them all together. It comes as a surprise, for instance, when she runs away from home and stays away for three months, with the emotional ramifications of that only nominally acknowledged by the quick summary of her later maturing process in an epilogue. MariNaomi does a wonderful job of painting a series of portraits of moments of adolescence, capturing its awkwardness and strangeness and excitement, but a greater whole never emerges.

{"asin": "0062004689", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Her 11th novel (after Downtown) finds Siddons squarely back on track with an immensely readable narrative that's been trimmed of excesses and?except for the ending?unnecessary melodrama. In fact, even the symbolism here is lean and explicit: Merritt Fowler is at the end of her emotional tether and about to crack; then the earth does, in an earthquake that imperils her and three people she loves. The fault lines in Merritt's character are common to women, Siddons implies. Since her mother's death when she was 13, Merritt has been a willing caretaker for members of her family: first her younger sister, \"fragile, lovely, hungry\" Laura, now 38 and still a would-be actress; then her husband Pom, a doctor dedicated to the patients in his Atlanta clinics but demanding and dictatorial at home; then Pom's Alzheimer's-demented mother, Mommee. Merritt knows she's shortchanging her 16-year-old daughter, Glynn, who has survived one bout with anorexia but is again close to despair because she feels neglected by her father. When Glynn runs away to her aunt Laura in California, Merritt follows to bring her home but is caught up in circumstances that will forever change the lives of all three women. If Siddons initially makes Merritt a bit too perfect, selfless and saintly, she nicely traces the flowering of her heroine's self-image during several crises and a bittersweet love affair. Settings are authentically rendered, from Atlanta's upper-crust social milieu to Hollywood's tawdry glitz and the serene beauty of the redwood country near Santa Cruz. Neatly alternating earthquake lore with steamy sex scenes, Siddons manages her absorbing, if predictable, narrative with panache?and though the earthquake is employed as a tear-jerking deus ex machina, readers will probably take the device as fair exchange for the various epiphanies and rites of passage that Glynn, Laura and Merritt experience. $250,000 ad/promo; first serial to Good Housekeeping; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club main selections; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Fault Lines: A Novel", "price": 8.0, "salesRank": {"Books": 162366}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514mer4hzML.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["006101141X", "0061032050", "0061256242", "1416553444", "0061099708", "0060837012", "0061099279", "B003UHUBMM", "0061010650", "0061093327", "0061874922", "0060538066", "1416553509", "B003H4RCNY", "0061099686", "0061715735", "0446527955", "0446618225", "044669830X", "0446618217", "B00A7JFRV6", "0062132520", "0062132466", "1476709017", "1476709009", "1250007038", "0062211765", "0451240596", "0451239687", "B005IUH9CO", "0385351852", "1416553533", "0778316203", "0778313476", "0425193942", "0425204316", "1416544909", "0778314529", "1439102759", "0062132474", "0778315894", "0778314790", "0553381539", "0312642725", "0142196991", "0316099767", "0060564679", "0061950726", "1250019729", "1594135061", "0778315991", "0060924373", "0061961299", "0061438464", "0062103083", "0451236769", "0425261360", "0451215117", "0778315827", "0316099783", "0425259692", "0061988332", "0061713546", "0345520351", "006016249X", "1476729719", "0778313387", "0425194183", "0061715700", "0778316815", "0345362721", "0778314596", "0385537131", "B000OA7SCY", "0006179223", "006109921X", "0345293304", "0061099732", "0061099694", "0060157585", "0061092894", "0060179333"], "bought_together": ["006101141X", "0061256242"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1416553444", "B003UHUBMM", "006101141X", "0060837012"]}}
{"asin": "0061998710", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Every night in the orphanage, 12-year-old Vince Elgin recites the traumatic tale of how his house burned to the ground and he lost his parents. His father's body was never recovered and the boy secretly wonders if he is still alive and waiting for him somewhere. When news reaches Vince that his estranged grandfather has passed away, he is hopeful that he can attend the funeral and perhaps be reunited with his dad. His hopes are dashed when the headmistress denies his travel and instead gives him The Dyerville Tales, his grandfather's memoirs of a magical world. Determined to leave, Vince plots a daring and successful escape and the story begins in earnest. The chapters alternate between his struggle to reach the funeral and the fantastical tales within the memoirs. Regrettably, this is where the promising fantasy begins to unravel. Individually, the two story lines are engaging and full of adventure, but combined they become diluted and confusing. Lurching from one plotline to the next, the novel becomes bogged down in the story-within-a-story format and loses focus.

Tilda never imagines how prophetic this is until she is taken hostage by her evil cousin Ivo, who is intent on wresting ownership of her castle away from her for himself. He believes it will be easy to take control of her principality because Tilda was born with a crippled foot and everyone believes she is cursed. He convinces her that no one in Alder Brook wants her as their princess. Secretly, Tilda is relieved because now she is free of her obligations and can make her own choices. With the help of Parzival, 14, a failed squire, and Judith, her loyal handmaiden, Tilda escapes, and they embark on a quest to slay dragons. During their adventures, the friends are captured and placed under a spell by a Bluebeard-like Lord who has buried seven wives and intends for Tilda to be his eighth. This fast-paced tale celebrates courage and perseverance. It refreshingly portrays Tilda as strong and intelligent yet flawed as she is forced to acknowledge her shortcomings and learn from her mistakes.

{"asin": "0062010298", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "PreS-Gr 1-Three costumed youngsters prance throughout their neighborhood on Halloween in this rhyming story that teaches tiny trick-or-treaters to \"just say BOO!\" to scary situations. The story begins wordlessly on the endpapers, where the children leave the house with their father. \"If the ghosts in the trees wibble-wobble your knees, what do you say?\" A quick turn of the page instructs readers to shout, \"BOO!\" The revelers encounter spooky shadows, whiny wind, flickering grins in a jack-o'-lantern, and groaning skeletons along their travels. When they reach a house, they say \"TRICK OR TREAT!\" instead, and then \"Thank you!\" The story continues homeward bound where their mother and a younger sibling are waiting. When the children shout out \"BOO\" at their door, the baby is startled, and the story ends with the older siblings teaching the toddler to \"just say BOO!\" The art is done in muted watercolors dipped in a fall palette of oranges, browns, and rusty reds. Touches of humor abound, keeping the story light and nonthreatening. The simple text will make this an interactive choice for fall sharing.

There are incisive historical essays on everything from Europeans' evolving image of the \"Unloved American\" to Churchill's oratory and, in a deliciously cruel book review, the \"pigmification of historical scale\" in micromonographs. There are meditations on the art of Rembrandt and Richard Avedon; reportage from British and American election campaigns; disdainful commentary on the Bush administration, and a stew to ice cream smorgasbord of foodie articles, recipes included. Schama is essentially the reporter-pundit with a chair in history, illuminating the most contemporary of topics in the buttery glow of historical context. One occasionally wonders whether that licenses him to write about absolutely everything: some pieces misfire&mdash;profiles of Martin Scorsese and Charlotte Rampling feel like generic celebrity puffery&mdash;and he lacks the distinctive style and outlook that would make you want to follow him all over the map.

As one of the most horrific crimes in modern history, these atrocities, the trial and the subsequent conviction of Charles Manson and his followers caused a media sensation, spawning movies, documentaries and bestselling books, including the classicHelter Skelter. A defining moment in an era otherwise associated with radical peace, love and understanding, this incident is one that still resonates with millions today.Yet while this crime left an indelible mark on society&#8217;s consciousness, it was, first and foremost, a shattering personal tragedy for those closest to Sharon&#8212;the loving family left to cope with the emotional devastation of her loss. Now, after nearly forty years, their story is finally revealed.Compiled by close family friend Alisa Statman and Sharon&#8217;s niece Brie Tate,Restless Soulsdraws on a wealth of material including interviews with the Tates, personal letters, tape recordings, home movies, public interviews, private journals, and official documents to provide a powerful, poignant, and affecting four-decade, three-generation memoir of crime and punishment, anguish and hope, rage and love, that is both a chronicle of death and a celebration of life.Extending beyond all previous accounts,Restless Soulsis the most revealing, riveting, and emotionally raw account not just of these heinous murders, the hunt and capture of the killers and the behind-the-scenes drama of their trials, but of the torment victims families&#8217; endure for years in the wake of such senseless violence.Tate family members set the record straight, correcting media misinformation and delving well beyond the official storyline to provide information, much of it available for the first time.

{"asin": "0062011839", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Hadley's fourth novel (after The Master Bedroom) is at once a melancholy and delightful story about Paul, a poet and father of three going through a midlife crisis in a small town outside of Cardiff, Wales, and Cora, a woman from his past whose impact on his life is minimal, and yet, for the reader, pivotal. What begins as an argument with a neighbor spirals into a domestic meltdown that sends Paul storming out and traveling to London to find Pia, his daughter from a former marriage, who, as it turns out, is pregnant, has dropped out of school, and is living in an illegal flat with her boyfriend. Paul, unsure how he should act, teeters back and forth from father figure to thrilled participant in her chaotic existence. Cora, on the other hand, has taken refuge from London in her recently deceased parents' house in Cardiff after separating from her husband and now enjoys the simplicity and the quiet of the country. Her narrative fleshes out the connection she has to Paul and reveals him to be a much weaker man than he'd like to acknowledge while simultaneously offering a smart take on starting over. Hadley's twin narratives are perfectly tuned and heavy with lacerating observations about the way fate works. (June)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

{"asin": "0062009494", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* On a stormy night in early Victorian London, an able young man named Dodger rises from the sewers in response to a scream, fights off two thugs, and rescues a damsel in distress. Dodger continues to rise throughout the novel, as his love for the mysterious lady motivates this tosher (scavenger for lost coins and other treasures in London&#x2019;s sewers) to elevate himself and leads him to a closer acquaintance with a string of historical figures, including Dickens, Disraeli, and ultimately, the queen and her consort. While most writers would be well advised not to include such characters in their books, Pratchett manages to humanize them without diminishing them or throwing the story off-kilter. However lowly Dodger&#x2019;s origins, he remains the most memorable character in the book. Living by his wits and unencumbered by conventional morality, this trickster hero expertly navigates the underbelly of his city as he carries out a bizarre scheme resulting in justice and mercy. The temptation to quote sentences, whole paragraphs, and possibly entire chapters is almost irresistible, because the pleasure of reading the novel is in the language as much as in the characters and well-researched period setting. Often amusing, this Victorian romp of a novel is lovingly crafted and completely enjoyable.

Told from the point of view of Tinkerbell, listeners live the story of Tiger Lily, daughter of cross-dressing shaman Tik Tok, and her role as wild girl in Neverland. When her arranged marriage to Giant looms closer, Tiger Lily defies her elders and discovers the burrow where Peter Pan and the Lost Boys live. As Tiger Lily spends more time with Peter than with her tribe, she begins to lose sight of a major dilemma facing her village: Englishman Philip forcing his beliefs on the &#x201C;savages.&#x201D; While the main focus of the story is the budding romance between the wild girl and the boy who never grew up, all the familiar characters from Neverland are given a new twist: Smee is more feared than Hook, Tinkerbell is not attached to Peter, and the boys are more like teenagers. Expertly narrated by Cassandra Morris, Tink's voice is captured effortlessly as she follows Tiger Lily around Neverland. Note that there are drinking references an dmild innuendos. Fans of the original Peter Pan (Barrie, 1911) and the acclaimed &#x201C;Peter and the Star Catchers&#x201D; series (Barry/Pearson 2006) will fall in love with Tiger Lily.&#x2013;Amanda Schiavulli Finger Lakes Library System, NY&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

But after three years spent at a frenetic pace, Sankovitch decided to slow down and rediscover the pleasure of books in order to reconnect with the memory of her sister. Despite the day-to-day responsibilities of raising four sons&mdash;and the holidays, vacations, and sudden illnesses that accompany a large family&mdash;Sankovitch vowed to read one book a day for an entire year and blog about it. In this entertaining bibliophile's dream, Sankovitch (who launched ReadAllDay.org and was profiled in the New York Times) found that her \"year of magical reading\" was \"not a way to rid myself of sorrow but a way to absorb it.\" As well as being an homage to her sister and their family of readers, Sankovitch's memoir speaks to the power that books can have over our daily lives. Sankovitch champions the act of reading not as an indulgence but as a necessity, and will make the perfect gift from one bookworm to another. (June)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Furthermore, Obama's \"record on torture, detention, and executive authority is even worse,\" and \"our constitutional system may never recover.\" Hodge, former editor in chief of Harper's Magazine, supports his arguments with lengthy discussion of historical politics, from the founding fathers through the Clinton and Bush administrations, and ends with a call to voters \"to alter its mode of government\" and \"provide new guards for our future security.\" Hodge's first book will interest a broad audience, from activists seeking to change the \"political will\" to academics seeking historical context.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

I give it now to my children and grandchildren, and to yours, so they will always know what it was like in America when people were free.Since the publication of her bestselling memoir,Going Rogue, in 2009, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has traveled the country extensively. She has visited cities and towns in almost every state, dropped in on military bases, given talks and speeches to small groups and at massive rallies. Throughout her travels, she has been privileged to meet thousands of Americans&mdash;ordinary men and women who have shared with her their hopes and dreams, their love of country, and their fears about what lies ahead. Governor Palin, inspired by these encounters, celebrates in her new book the enduring strengths and virtues that have made this country a beacon of liberty and hope for the rest of the world.America by Heartis a highly personal testament to her deep love of country, her strong roots in faith, and her profound appreciation of family.

The simple songs, none more than two stanzas long, focus on gentle aspects of the nighttime world: sleepy animals, ocean rhythms, the contrast between outside and cozy indoors. &#x201C;And while the rabbits hop and hop/The starry night away,/My little baby softly sleeps/ Until the break of day.&#x201D; Two selections feature a mother's voice, two others have a father's, and there are one each for grandfathers and grandmothers.

{"asin": "0062005987", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In his newest book, Rosen (More than a Game) follows the ups and down of the New York Yankees bullpen over the course of the 2010 season, focusing on game recaps in which he evaluates how each reliever performed. He gives a solid overview of the scouting system used by Major League teams to rate and scout pitchers, and interviews players and coach. Rosen's affection for the sport is infections, though by focusing specifically on what happened when the relievers were pitching makes his narrative feel incomplete. Also many of the conversations with or about the players revolve around stock answers about the pitching mechanics of arm action and foot placement so that readers get little insight into each pitcher, except for minor leaguer Jason Hirsh. His narrative is highlighted by charming personal pieces titled \"Memory Lane,\" in which he recounts his life growing up a Yankee fan, as well as offering fun, historical facts that bring the game to life.

The Savage manifesto you hold in your hands shows how Obama is circumventing the Constitution to push through his radical agenda&#8212;and, most important, how we can restore our country to the power and prestige that Barack Obama and his corrupt and degenerate \"czars\" are trying to destroy.The Naked Marxist can and must be stopped. Obama's trickle up poverty is infecting all that we hold to be true and self-evident. Here's how:Impoverishing the Middle Class: Obama's confiscatory taxes, the socializing of our health-care system, and other legislative initiatives are taking away our earnings and our power to choose how we live our lives and putting it in the hands of corrupt and pro-Socialist cohorts.Erasing Our Border with Mexico: The Homeland Security department that can't shoot straight is gutting the Constitution in the name of protecting illegal aliens when it should be focusing on keeping out the terrorists and drug dealers.Defunding the Military and Putting Our Troops in Harm's Way: Obama's beatnik policy of taking apart our nuclear arsenal and destroying NASA, while implementing PC Rules of Engagement that don't allow our troops to protect themselves, is dangerously weakening our security and ending our military dominance.Lining the Pockets of His Wall Street Buddies: While our 401(k)'s suffer, Obama and his Wall Street heavy contributors are creating their own legislation that is driving down stock prices while allowing his biggest campaign contributors to maketrillionsof dollars.Propagandizing the Media: Once a forum for free speech, Obama's administration has systematically overrun the media in a hostile takeover with threats and false promises that serve only to pull the wool over the sheeple's eyes.Ignoring the Tea Party&#8212;the Voice of the People: No longer a representative government, Obama is blatantly disregarding, and even suppressing, the fastest-growing collective voice in the nation right now&#8212;that of the patriotic Tea Party. His Union-Crony Purple Shirts have shown up at town-hall meetings and peaceful protests to intimidate and antagonize the democratic process.We are dangerously close to losing the nation we love, but it's not too late.

It was a prophecy that their last king had given on his deathwatch.\" But joy is mixed with tragedy, for Eleonora's mother dies soon after the birth.Raised by her doting father, Yakob, a carpet merchant, and her stern, resentful stepmother, Ruxandra, Eleonora spends her early years daydreaming and doing housework&#x2014;until the moment she teaches herself to read, and her father recognizes that she is an extraordinarily gifted child, a prodigy.When Yakob sets off by boat for Stamboul on business, eight-year-old Eleonora, unable to bear the separation, stows away in one of his trunks. On the shores of the Bosporus, in the house of her father's business partner, Moncef Bey, a new life awaits.

Was Eleonora based on anyone?Lukas:I started writingThe Oracle of Stamboulin early 2004. At the time I was living in Tunisia, studying Arabic, applying to MFA programs, and generally trying to figure out what to do with my life. Eleonora came to me on a run through the undeveloped outskirts of Tunis. She was hazy in that first glimpse, a slight, precocious child playing backgammon with two older men. I didn&#x2019;t know anything about her&#x2014;where she lived or when, who these men were, why she was playing backgammon with them&#x2014;but I knew as soon as she came to me that I had found the protagonist of my novel. At first, I thought of her as a mix between Alice fromAlice in Wonderlandand Roald Dahl&#x2019;sMatilda. A few months later, rummaging through an antique store in Istanbul, I came across a picture of a young girl from the 1880s. When I saw this picture, everything clicked. Here was Eleonora, staring out across history with a laconic, penetrating gaze. Over the next six years, she took on a life and character of her own. Eleonora still has elements of Alice, Matilda, and the girl in the picture, but she has become her own person.Q:Would you consider the novel to be a fairy tale?Lukas:The Oracle of Stamboulis very much inspired by fairy tales. Before I began writing the third draft of the novel, I made a point of reading Maria Tartar&#x2019;s annotated version of the Brothers&#x2019; Grimm. Reading these wonderful, dark, and intimately familiar stories again&#x2014;as an adult and as a writer&#x2014;helped me understand my novel in a new way. The Brothers&#x2019; Grimm taught me the power of a single magical object and the importance of simplicity, in both plot and character. Their stories also reminded me that I wantedThe Oracle of Stamboulto be more than a fairy tale. I wanted the novel to have the wonder and familiarity of a story like &#x201C;Hansel and Gretel&#x201D; or &#x201C;Rapunzel,&#x201D; but I also wanted it to incorporate the magic of place and the sweep of history.Q:How might readers of different ages experience the book?Lukas:I hopeThe Oracle of Stamboulwill appeal to a wide range of readers: people who love reading for its power to transport, to inform, and to inspire; adults who read literary novels; and those adults who read the occasional young adult novel; precocious teenagers; those who want to learn about the Ottoman Empire or Istanbul; and anyone who wants to connect with the preternaturally intelligent child inside them. One could read the novel for Eleonora&#x2019;s story, for the sense of history, for the sense of place, or for the various historical questions I hope the book raises. And none of these readings is better than the others.Q:Who are the writers and books that have influenced you the most? What books do you think are complementary in style or mien toThe Oracle of Stamboul?Lukas:Among many others,The Oracle of Stamboulis influenced by Charles Dickens, Roald Dahl, Italo Calvino, and Gabriel Garc&#xED;a M&#xE1;rquez. During the year I started writing the book I had a lot of free time. In the period of a few months I read most of Vladimir Nabokov, John Steinbeck, James Baldwin, and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, all writers I look to still for inspiration. I was most taken, however, by those whose work falls into the subgenre I like to call historical fabulism&#x2014;Jos&#xE9; Saramago, G&#xFC;nter Grass, and Salman Rushdie&#x2014;storytellers of the old school who add a pinch of magic to the stew of history. I was particularly moved by Saramago&#x2019;s novelThe History of the Siege of Lisbon, in which a bored proofreader literally rewrites the history of Lisbon, and by Grass&#x2019;sThe Tin Drum, in which a clairvoyant young German boy named Oskar Matzerath disrupts the traditional narrative of World War II by beating on a tin drum. How wonderful, this idea that a single act, a single person, might change the course of history.Q:You teach creative writing to third and fourth graders. What have you learned from working with them?Lukas:This past semester my students participated in National Novel Writing Month. It was kind of a crazy idea, but it worked wonderfully. One student wrote a novel about a panda who is adopted by mice. Another student wrote about a ghostly tooth fairy who is his own worst enemy. And then there was the pair who collaborated on a novel about a moldy pickle and a moldy cucumber who are best friends and want more than anything to escape the refrigerator. When I started teaching the creative writing to third and fourth graders&#x2014;through an afterschool program called Take My Word For It!&#x2014;I was going through a bit of a quarter life crisis. My students&#x2019; wide-eyed enthusiasm and seemingly-infinite imaginations helped me to regain my sense of wonder and possibility in the world. And they taught me that no idea is too crazy.", "title": "The Oracle of Stamboul: A Novel", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 1152563}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hkbXN%2BmIL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1439156433", "0755377699", "0385343841", "1477807616", "0312426135", "0062244752", "0345514769", "006204981X", "0143112716", "0385721420", "B004IK9E14", "0812981227", "0307744426", "0307386244", "0307947726", "B00D1G9V7I", "1400033888", "B007MXCBPA", "0679643656", "0375706852", "0345516532", "0316175668", "0743298039", "1439102813", "0307744434", "0345525558", "0061928178", "1455575992", "0307476073", "0316176494", "0440180295", "1451681755", "1400052181", "0758278454", "1594632340", "0670024783", "0802122558", "0385344430"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0375706852"]}}

{"asin": "0062008110", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The main drama in Bronte's novel happens in a long narrative told by an elderly housekeeper to a convalescing new tenant. This story-within-a-story setup makes it well suited for audio adaptation, as Scales takes the housekeeper's part and relates the past, while West performs as the tenant and describes the present. Scales primarily uses a folksy lower-class accent, but she also makes her voice harsh and threatening when speaking as Heathcliff, the surly man at the novel's heart. West, as the bewildered tenant, manages to sound both nervous and pretentious, but his part is fairly small, especially with this abridgment, so he mostly serves to provide transitions for the housekeeper's story. The extensive abridgment generally deletes sentences and phrases rather than entire paragraphs or sections. One drawback for the audio format is the difficulty of clarifying the novel's convoluted plot and family tree, since it's harder to search back through long CD tracks than through earlier chapters of the paperback. While a little of the depth of Bronte's writing is lost in abridgment, the novel's emotional core remains intact and wrenching, and the actors' heartfelt interpretations make it easy to imagine being curled up by a warm fire listening to an absorbing tale. In June, Penguin Audio remastered and released on CD for the first time nine other Penguin Classics: Crime and Punishment, Dracula, Frankenstein, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Moby Dick, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Tale of Two Cities.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Then Jack got a sliver of a magic mirror in his eye and his heart grew cold. Soon he was snatched away by an evil woman in a sleigh into a strange magical world where snow and cold abound-a place where his frozen emotions seem perfectly at home. Does Hazel have the heart to risk everything to find her friend and bring him back? In Anne Ursu's book (Walden Pond Press, 2011) we find a creepy, compelling homage to Hans Christian Andersen in a story based on \"The Snow Queen.\" Vibrant threads from other Andersen stories are woven into the tale, creating a brilliant tapestry. There are also references to both classic and modern fantasy tales, showing that all are related. The underlying theme of friendship that is constant and true, sacrifice, and choosing reality over fantasy is beautifully written.

She is immediately befriended by her neighbor, the beautiful but eccentric Pauline, and her childhood BFF, the gentle Liam. The three become inseparable&#x2014;although beneath the surface a simmering romantic tension is clearly brewing. Things come to a head when girls begin to mysteriously disappear and Pauline is sent away. With the dynamic of Maggie and Liam's relationship now intensifying, the bonds of friendship and loyalty are in question. The journey of self-discovery taken by each character tests their true nature and forces decisions that will change their lives forever. Anderson crafts a heartbreaking story full of mystery, love, redemption, and betrayal. The subtle writing draws readers in from the beginning, while the complex and intriguing characters beautifully drive the measured pacing of the plot. The interspersed first-person ghostly narrative adds an eerie sense of dread and foreboding. Yet it is the stark and realistic portrayal of events coupled with a startling conclusion that make this such a powerful read.&#x2014;Donna Rosenblum, Floral Park Memorial High School, NY", "title": "The Vanishing Season", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 84972}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512xptbv6tL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062220004", "0399167773", "1622662687", "1250049377", "0062290363", "0062135961", "0062105485", "0805099239", "0062280678", "1595147225", "0545424968", "0062014552", "080509461X", "0374384673", "0062293605", "0062259601", "038574126X", "0062003267", "0062271105", "0545654572", "0316134074", "0062265970", "0452297540", "0062085573", "006202650X", "006222560X", "1423157516", "0062345214", "1595143211", "1250030951", "0399162429", "0670012092", "0062278819", "1250036429", "0062318322", "0062085506", "0670016780", "0765335344", "0805094601", "0373210582", "0399256938", "0062014536", "0062135953", "039925725X", "1423146174"], "bought_together": ["0399167773"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1416906088", "0062059947", "0399167838", "0062003267"]}}

{"asin": "006201448X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "New York Times columnist Barry provides a charming, meditative portrait of a minor league baseball game that seemed to last forever. Because of a rule-book glitch, the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings played for 33 innings on a chilly Saturday night into the Easter morning of 1981. Using the game as a focal point, Barry examines the lives and future careers of many of the players, including the then unknown Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken. Barry also profiles the Red Sox team owner, the fans and workers, and even the stadium and the depressed industrial town of Pawtucket, R.I. The game gives Barry ample opportunity to explore the world that surrounds it. Not every Triple-A player becomes a Cal Ripken, and Barry gives generous attention to those who didn't make it&mdash;the powerful outfielder who can't hit a curve, the eccentric Dutch relief pitcher with the unlikely name of Win Remmerswaal, the 26-year-old who feels like an old man among younger prospects. The three decades that have passed since the game allow Barry to track the arc of entire lives, adding emotional resonance. Barry is equally adept at describing the allure of a ballpark and the boost it can give to a struggling town like Pawtucket. (Apr.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Spanning 57 years, Sofia Tolstoy's diaries are an extraordinary chronicle of a woman who was her husband's secretary, proofreader, editor, housekeeper, agent, and nurse. Though she notes countless quarrels, the marriage grew from a youthful romance and had many happy moments. \"Could any marriage be more... harmonious than ours?\" But as the years pass, marital discord flares up more often. Spurning worldly concerns, Tolstoy leaves his wife in charge of the estate and children (\"A man of genius is always so much better in his works than his life!\" she laments). As she works tirelessly on his behalf, resentments accumulate and by the end of Tolstoy's life their relationship is marred by power struggles between Sofia, her children, and acolyte Vladimir Chertov over ownership of the Tolstoy's work. No doubt Sofia could be vain (\"I want people to... say how pretty I am,\" she writes, \"to my own horror\"), but she was a remarkable woman, tireless worker, and an unrelenting advocate for her husband to the end of his life. She yearned for the pleasure of her own creative pursuits, often questioned her fate, and even contemplated suicide, but she never doubted Leo's genius or wavered in her commitment to his legacy. For that, generations of readers owe her a debt of gratitude. (Sept.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

{"asin": "0062012010", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 9 Up-This paranormal sequel to Starcrossed (HarperCollins, 2011) continues demigod Helen's quest to descend into the Underworld to try to defeat the Furies and end thousands of years of endless killing among her kin. In this world, Helen and her demigod cousins are descended from one of Four Houses, and the Furies make them all enemies of one another. Despite the fact that Helen and Lucas were from enemy Houses and wanted to kill each other in Starcrossed, they fell in love and then discovered that they were first cousins. Now, they're finding it hard to resist their mutual attration, despite knowing its wrong. Then Orion shows up to rival Lucas for Helen's affections. Helen can fly and throw lightning bolts but makes mistakes and, like all the Gods, is guilty of hubris. She finds herself in horrific situations and the only way she can end each night so she can wake up to try again is to die - by quicksand, falling, etc.-and this is taking a terrible physical toll on her. The violence that the Gods and demigods inflict upon one another is compelling, but also brutal. Enough of the events from Starcrossed are recounted that it's not essential to have read it first. Unfinished events in this book guarantee another installment in this series that's loosely based on the Helen of Troy myth. The family dynamics in this romantic, action-packed tale are reminiscent of the \"Twilight\" series and will appeal to \"Percy Jackson\" fans who are ready for more mature fare.-Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

{"asin": "006201580X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "PreS-Gr 2-Berger is captivated by the look of the landscape after it has snowed and the interest that lines, shapes, textures, and light add to the view. Her cut-paper compositions build snow-covered hills with ledger-book paper that has been brushed with paint; the pale blue script and lines show through, adding depth and mystery. The text floats down with the flakes in the opening spread. On the following pages, tall bare trees and, later, glowing lampposts add a vertical dimension to the horizontal world. Children emerge singly and in small groups. First the focus is on footprints and the lines from skis and skates. Then it is on the fun of throwing snowballs, making snowmen and forts, and sledding. The climax is a spread of 18 snow angels, after which the youngsters proceed to their respective homes, which are spread out on the hillsides as in a Currier and Ives scene. Berger's brief narrative describes the children's actions; it is the pictures that convey the wonder. A quiet celebration of a phenomenon that transforms everything it touches.-Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

{"asin": "0062014641", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In Behold the Bold Umbrellaphant (2006), Prelutsky and Berger combined forces to delight with uproarious poems about animals crossed with inanimate objects. Here they continue their zoological compendium, adding animals infused with personality traits (&#x201C;SLOBSTERS are slovenly, / SLOBSTERS are crude. / SLOBSTERS love mashing / And smushing their food&#x201D;; &#x201C;PLANDAS sit around all day, / Planning what to do&#x201D;). Prelutsky offers a wide variety of form and meter, and the poems consistently bounce with the rhythmic vitality and sparkling surprise we have come to expect from him. Each poem enjoys a two-page spread, illuminated in Berger&#x2019;s three-dimensional dioramas built of carefully cut paper and found objects and decorated with pins and tags and other trappings of scientific specimen cases. Poet and artist clearly share a comic sensibility (witness the JOLLYFISH&#x2019;s dentures), and their partnership bears symbiotic fruit. Adults will have great success sharing these poems with groups, but it won&#x2019;t be long before kids are reading them to one another.      HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Prelutsky is poetry royalty, and teachers and librarians will be eager to share his latest.

In this entry, set in 1920, Rutledge applies his formidable detecting skills to the case of Wyatt Russell, a terminally ill man who confesses to murdering his cousin. Rutledge doesn&#x2019;t believe Russell for a moment, and a lunch meeting with the dying man does nothing to change his mind. Armed with just a few leads, Rutledge journeys to an obscure corner of Essex, where the locals receive him with equal parts loathing and fear. The cold case becomes even more chilling when Russell is fatally shot. Rutledge continues to probe, as a singular question consumes his thoughts. Why would Russell confess to a crime he didn&#x2019;t commit?

{"asin": "0062014455", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "PreS-Gr 2-Tegen's story recalls Raymond Briggs's wordless classic, The Snowman (Random, 1978). In this version, George is, at first, bored watching the blizzard outside. But the next morning, he bundles up and plunges into the deep, fluffy world of white. He proceeds to build a snowman and dress it up with button eyes, a carrot nose, twigs for arms and mouth, a hat, and a scarf. Is it smiling at him? After a snack of cookies and hot chocolate (which the snowman can't drink), George builds a snow cave. He and the animated snowman have a grand time throwing snowballs at each other and racing around the yard until dark. The next day, it is warmer. They play some more, although George notices the snowman is not as peppy. The following day is Monday and George goes to school. By the time he returns home, most of the snow, including his winter friend, has melted. But the next day, it is snowing again, and George is ready to build another snowman. The descriptive story and Dorman's realistic illustrations convincingly capture the boy's wonder and joy of celebrating winter days with a magical friend. George's understanding that his creation will eventually melt but can be built again gives the story an upbeat ending. Although no new ground is broken here, this is a pleasant addition to storytime shelves.-Martha Simpson, Stratford Library Association, CT&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

{"asin": "0062011847", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Author One-to-One: Neil Gaiman Interviews Terry PratchettNeil Gaiman&rsquo;s best-selling novels includeNeverwhere,American Gods,Coraline,Anansi Boys, andGood Omens(with Terry Pratchett). He is the creator of the Sandman series of graphic novels and author of the short-fiction collectionsSmoke and Mirrors and Fragile Things.Neil Gaiman:Where did the idea forSnufforiginate?Terry Pratchett:I haven&rsquo;t a clue, but I think I started out by considering the character of Sir Samuel Vimes, as he now is, and since I find his inner monologue interesting I decided to use the old and well-tried plot device of sending a policeman on holiday somewhere he can relax, because we all know the way this one is supposed to go. And then I realised that moving Vimes out of his city element and away from his comfort zone was going to be a sheer treat to write.Gaiman:The Watch fascinate me. You get to do hardboiled police procedurals while still writing funny smart books set in a fantastic world.Pratchett:On a point of order, Mister Gaiman, the world in which Sam Vimes finds himself is hardly fantastic. Okay, there are goblins, but the overall ambience is that of the shires of Middle England. It&rsquo;s all about the commonality of humankind. Shove Sam Vimes into a situation that has gone toxic and away he goes, as realistic as any other policeman and thinking in the very same ways and being Sam Vimes, questioning his motives and procedures all the way through.Gaiman:Did you really say in a previous interview that you&rsquo;d like to be like Sam Vines? Why?Pratchett:I don&rsquo;t think I actually said that, but you know how it is and &lsquo;how it is&rsquo; changes as you get older. The author can always delve into his own personality and find aspects of himself with which he can dress his characters. If you pushed me I would say that ever since I stood up and talked about my Alzheimer&rsquo;s I have been a public figure; I visited Downing Street twice, wrote angry letters to theTimes, got into debates in the House of Commons, and generally became a geezer to the extent that I sit here sometimes bewildered and think to myself, &ldquo;Actually, your job is to sit here writing another book.  Changing the world is forotherpeople...&rdquo; and then I come back to myself with, &ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And so, bearing in mind that these days, people call a kid from the council houses &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; allows me to create a mindset for Vimes.Gaiman:On a piece about writing in theNew York Times, Carl Hiaasen (a writer you started me reading on theGood Omenstour), wrote, &ldquo;Every writer scrounges for inspiration in different places, and there's no shame in raiding the headlines. It's necessary, in fact, when attempting contemporary satire. Sharp-edged humor relies on topical reference points... Unfortunately for novelists, real life is getting way too funny and far-fetched.&rdquo;  Does the Discworld as a setting allow you to escape from that? Or is it a tool that lets you raid the headlines in ways people might not expect?Pratchett:I think that&rsquo;s the commonality of humankind again. I hope that everyone in Discworld is a recognisable and understandable character and so sometimes I can present them with modern and contemporary problems, such as Mustrum Ridcully getting his head around homosexuality.In truth, I never have to go looking for this stuff; I turn to find it smacking me in the face. I was very pleased whenMaking Moneycame out just before the banking crisis and everyone said I had predicted it. It was hardly difficult.Gaiman:How has the Discworld changed over the years?Pratchett:I suppose the simple answer is that there is still humour, but the gags are no longer set up; they are derived from characters&rsquo; personalities and situations. These days the humour seems to arrive of its own accord.Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how you see the world?Pratchett:I think it more true that getting older changes how you see the world. There is stuff inSnuff, for example, that I couldn&rsquo;t have written at 25. Although I had written things before Discworld, I really leaned writing, on the job as it were, on Discworld. I think that the books are, if not serious, dealing with more serious subjects. These days it&rsquo;s not just for laughs. My world view had changed; sometimes I feel that the world is made up of sensible people who know that plot and bloody idiots who don&rsquo;t. Of course, all Discworld fans know the plot by heart!Gaiman:How has writing the Discworld novels changed how the world sees you?Pratchett:Has it? My agent pointed out one day that I had been quoted by a columnist in some American newspaper, and he noted with some glee that they simply identified me by name without reminding people who I was, apparently in the clear expectation that their readers would know who I am. I have quite a large number of honorary doctorates; I am a professor of English at Trinity College Dublin and a fellow of King&rsquo;s College London, on top of all the other stuff, including the knighthood. However, when it gets to the sub-editors I am always going to be that writer of wacky fantasy, though I have to say that dismissiveness is getting rarer and rarer.Gaiman:Are you respectable?Pratchett:Is this a trick question? If so, then I shall say yes. Generally speaking I try to obey the law, pay my taxes (of which there are an enormous lot), give to charity, and write letters to theTimesthat they print.It&rsquo;s a weird term, respectable; isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;respek&rsquo; what every street kid wants and might possibly expect at the point of a knife? I certainly get involved with things and shortly after finishing this interview will be annoying my local MP. It&rsquo;s fun.

{"asin": "0062015273", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950), winner in 1923 of the second annual Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, was a daring, versatile writer whose work includes plays, essays, short stories, songs, and the libretto to an opera that premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera House to rave reviews.Millay infused new life into traditional poetic forms, bringing new hope to a generation of youth disillusioned by the political and social upheaval of the First World War. She ventured fearlessly beyond familiar poetic subjects to tackle political injustice, social discrimination, and women's sexuality in her poems and prose. In the 1920s and '30s, Millay was considered a spokesperson for personal freedom in America, particularly for women, and we turn to her lines to illuminate the social history of the period and the Bohemian lifestyle she and her friends enjoyed.Yet Millay's poetry is still decisively modern in its message, and it continues to resonate with readers facing personal and moral issues that defy the test of time: romantic love, loss, betrayal, compassion for one another, social equality, patriotism, and the stewardship of the natural world.Collected Poemsfeatures Millay's incisive and impassioned lyric poetry and sonnets, many of which are considered among the finest in the language, as well as the poet's last volume,Mine the Harvest, compiled and published in 1956 by her sister Norma Millay.", "title": "Collected Poems", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 95532}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51h45h-nqSL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0375760814", "0805071814", "0486411044", "048626873X", "0143106082", "0307592669", "0060910917", "039457589X", "0061558893", "1566637031", "0679443673", "0684807319", "0140188517", "0385086016", "0316184136", "0395957761", "0151011958", "0062089390", "1555976352", "0375761233", "081120958X", "1168660556", "0151189781", "1598532103", "1931082413", "0811209717", "0802130720", "0307278085", "1905716834", "0374526788", "0374532737", "0374534098", "0374518173", "0679764089", "0374522812", "0805005021", "0199539022", "0060908890", "B008220BA2", "0143106430", "0060732601", "0547571607", "0374532311", "0143039539", "0307739635", "1555975844", "080931973X", "0486434680", "0803226616", "B00008H2GY"], "bought_together": ["0375760814", "0805071814"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0307592669", "0060908890", "0375761233", "0899682669"]}}

{"asin": "0062014579", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Prelutsky presents more than 100 humorous poems in loose groupings, brought to buoyant life by Urbanovic&#x2019;s lively pen-and-ink gestures. Though uniformly and squarely aimed at the elementary-school funny bone, the poems represent a wide variety of form and style. Some, like &#x201C;The Pelicantaloupes&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Appleopards,&#x201D; imagine an unlikely cross between an animal and a fruit and come accompanied by pronunciation assistance. Others find silliness in everyday circumstance, while most veer toward the hilarious and totally unexpected (like &#x201C;Shopping at a Dragon Store&#x201D;). A few haiku find their way in, as do the odd limerick and concrete poem. Many share a common meter (think &#x201C;Miss Lucy had a steamboat&#x201D;), making them particularly well suited to be read, or chanted, aloud. Urbanovic&#x2019;s cartoony black-and-white line drawings enjoy ample real estate, spreading across pages to reinforce the poetic puns. It&#x2019;s easy to imagine this one being passed around the cafeteria or safely stored in a backpack.

With nods to Dahl, Dickens, the Grimms and even Burnett, the author has made something truly original. Acedera&#8217;s frequent black-and-white illustrations are a perfect complement. An irresistible read: This book sings.&#8221; (Kirkus Reviews (starred review))&#8220;Classic fairy tale elements weave throughout this spirited, old-fashioned adventure. Invigorating and hopeful, this novel testifies to the power of friendship and generosity to conquer greed and depression.&#8221; (Publishers Weekly (starred review))&#8220;With her third book, Lauren Oliver (Before I Fall; Delirium) creates another highly original world, this one for middle-grade readers. Oliver introduces orphans Liesl and Will, a touch of magic, some delectable coincidences, and friendship that stretches from the Living Side to the Other Side.&#8221; (Shelf Awareness)&#8220;A gorgeous story--timeless and magical.&#8221; (Rebecca Stead, Newbery Medal-winning author of When You Reach Me)&#8220;Liesl & Po by Lauren Oliver brings much-needed magic to an increasingly neglected age group.

You&#8217;ll have no choice but to tear through this book!&#8221; (Jay Asher, author of the New York Times bestseller Thirteen Reasons Why)Praise for Before I Fall:&#8220;Before I Fall is smart, complex, and heartbreakingly beautiful. Lauren Oliver has written an extraordinary debut novel about what it means to live&#151;and die.&#8221; (Carolyn Mackler, author of Tangled and The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things, a Printz Honor book)Praise for Delirium:&#8220;In [Oliver&#8217;s] dystopian America, love has been outlawed as the life-threatening source of all discord. Lena&#8217;s gradual awakening is set against a convincing backdrop of totalitarian horror. The abrupt ending leaves enough unanswered questions to set breathless readers up for volume two of this trilogy.&#8221; (Kirkus Reviews (starred review))Praise for Delirium:&#8220;Strong characters, a vivid portrait of the lives of teens in a repressive society, and nagging questions that can be applied to our world today make this book especially compelling and discussable.&#8221; (School Library Journal (starred review))", "title": "Liesl &amp; Po", "price": 5.98, "salesRank": {"Books": 676710}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ATDk%2BtZhL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00D9TBLL6", "0545208629", "1596436913", "0399252223", "0061857602", "1599905248", "0375841989", "1419701908", "0061962783", "1620140047", "1419700251", "1606840533", "1416971025", "1561455954", "1423133633", "1419701940", "039925627X", "0062008137", "1596436956", "0803735340", "0385908334", "0312649614", "0399252649", "0385740301", "0763641553", "006172680X", "1416963782", "0062122207", "0545433150", "0062015052", "0375868704", "0142419672", "0545274249", "0375852263", "0316114278", "0374350957", "0316213101", "1250003377", "0375856056", "0375858512", "0805094601", "0142425060", "1423157230", "0061992259", "076366040X", "1416963987", "0312649622", "0062014552", "0545162157", "1442407689", "1596434465", "1596438762", "B0085RZXXY", "0375866566", "1416949305", "0525425926", "0802723349", "1599906449", "0803734077", "1250010195", "0385737432", "1442421053", "1423157370", "0525426159", "1596434872", "0062102567", "0545270111", "0545654572", "0316370312", "1423178203", "0062224077", "1416949321", "0763653802", "1596434473", "1442422017", "1423157516", "0316068659", "160684153X", "B009NPJL9Y", "0062089560", "0060853980", "0375872132", "0545162165", "0399257853", "0316068683", "0062014536", "0525421033", "1619630621", "0763663336", "0805094598", "0399246525", "0142417750", "0062070401", "0312641893", "0062102605", "0375869026", "1419711326", "080509461X", "0316134074"], "bought_together": ["B00D9TBLL6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1250010195", "0375852263", "076366040X", "0545162165"]}}

{"asin": "0062011308", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* The Gospel of John differs from Mark, Matthew, and Luke in terms of style, tone, and many of the events described. Further, the gospels tendency to negatively call out &#x201C;the Jews&#x201D; has led, in many ways, to anti-Semitism. So it&#x2019;s surprising that Spong, a former bishop and educator who has written persuasively about the need for a nontheistic Christianity, would choose to devote a book to John. And in fact, Spong writes about his difficulties coming to terms with John&#x2019;s message. But, in his eighty-second year, Spong feels he at last understands John, seeing it now in a new light, as the writing of a Jewish mystic. He moves readers deliberately through the pages of the gospel, explaining by example how he&#x2019;s come to his conclusions. John, he maintains, was written after the Johanine community had been expelled from the synagogue. Consequently, John&#x2019;s purpose in writing is to use Jewish symbolism to explain Jesus and his movement to those who would not or could not accept him. Spong himself says that many of the ideas here&#x2014;let&#x2019;s boil it down to God is love&#x2014;aren&#x2019;t new. But Spong is writing for a lay audience, and he does so magnificently. His thoughts are bracing, his writing exciting, and his conclusions thought provoking. Those who love reading about religion in general and Christianity in particular may want to go through this volume more than once. --Ilene Cooper", "title": "The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic", "price": 14.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 27142}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41i1jOM-DfL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0060778423", "0060778415", "0062011294", "0060675578", "0060675365", "0062011286", "0062109367", "0062269976", "0062082116", "0060675187", "0060670630", "0060778407", "1611800528", "0060675209", "0060674296", "0062024353", "0061778184", "0060675071", "006067539X", "1616367016", "006067556X", "0060675233", "B001KBZ6AW", "0061434345", "006197658X", "0829820027", "0062082108", "140006922X", "0547792107", "1616367571", "0849946026", "0944344747", "1585420670", "0375703160", "0062294857", "0060609176", "B00E8UZWI8", "0060762055", "B004NSVGEO", "006063040X", "0061875694", "0061430730", "0061875708", "0664239285", "0809148676", "0824514122", "0060609192", "0062003747", "1594735425", "0060730684", "0195297709", "0827609086", "0971428913", "0807029122", "1610974085", "1577319524", "0801014808", "1612612962", "1455527084", "0060616296", "0824519264", "1456839403", "0807072435", "160868265X", "0394711556", "1491077328", "1594632588", "0060670843", "0061568228", "1118061594", "0061430714", "0060675322", "0802870724", "0470183500", "0060872608", "0809121743", "0877930414", "0664235034", "0060872632", "0664239145", "1598151398", "1455514004", "0664244653", "0615744052", "1606741144", "1570252467", "0060675098", "1561011894", "1118303598", "1598151312", "006223496X", "0062322125", "006180035X", "0143121634", "0814612830", "149595501X", "1594770182", "0809135167", "0944344801"], "bought_together": ["0060778423", "0062011294"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060778423", "0062011294", "0060675578", "0060675187"]}}

Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee of the tribal police work together here, trying to solve crimes that resist logic. There are no clues to three homicides or to the attempted murder of Chee. Leaphorn thinks a \"skinwalker,\" or witch, could have attacked the victims, all adherents of shamanism, as they are otherwise unrelated. The skinwalkers represent a schism between witchcraft and the traditional Navajo Way. A second attempt on Chee bolsters Leaphorn's suspicion since Chee is an aspiring shaman. The story gathers momentum and tension as the partners get closer to the moment when the murderer comes into the open, and the tragic reason for the crimes becomes painfully clear. 30,000 first printing; BOMC alternate; author tour.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Skinwalkers", "price": 5.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 60914}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61m8oucckEL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061808407", "0061967785", "0061808377", "0062018027", "0061967769", "0061808350", "0061808393", "0061808385", "0061967831", "0061808369", "0061967777", "0061967807", "0062018043", "0060563478", "0061967823", "0061967815", "0061967793", "0062068431", "006206844X", "0874806208", "0061374296", "0062270486", "B000V2IOXC", "0060505869", "0061092622", "0742554643", "0061000280", "0062270494", "B0000JCFN6", "B002IFSA8O", "1607811375", "0517092816", "0060538058", "1482393182", "B000AXWHP8", "051707771X", "B00015YVPO", "006109918X", "0385335474", "B007C1XMJG", "0062196200", "B003ILJQU8", "B0071K0I0Y", "B007C1Z4AG", "B002BF947C", "0826307760", "006016400X", "0743219554", "B005MZ53RI", "0670026468", "0749082690", "0312947739", "0060955643", "006017773X", "0679722645", "0826309100", "1492358444", "0765334038", "0143123297", "0060563451", "014312546X", "1568496958", "0312994621", "0380790300", "0060163704", "0143119532", "0312947747", "0826351921", "B000RAEKRM", "0143117319", "0380790297", "0143120980", "1416505210", "0553212419", "0143113496", "0060159383", "0061098787", "0060545437", "1250034736", "0060192895", "0060937122", "1741794668", "0670015784", "0394758285", "0061119911", "1482353474", "1455504734", "0147508770", "0143113135", "0062073567", "0312548893", "0380803941", "1489591508", "0060820780", "0425252256", "0380714590", "0446400157", "0061859974", "0345435648"], "bought_together": ["0061808407", "0061808350"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061808350", "0061808385", "0061967769", "0062018027"]}}

{"asin": "0062019201", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "With its boisterous humor and lovable characters, the newest entry in Hill's time-travel series (following Truly, Madly Viking) will charm the socks off of readers. Magnus Ericsson, a brawny Viking from the 10th century, sets out with nine of his 11 children to find new lands when his longship drifts off course and ends up smack in the middle of a Hollywood set. Mistaken for an \"act-whore\" auditioning for a Viking film, he snags the producer's attention as well as the interest of gorgeous realtor Angela Abruzzi. Angela agrees to take Magnus and his kids in, with the caveat that her family's Sonoma County vineyard, be the setting for the producer's next flick. Though buff, Magnus is none too swift, and it takes him a while to realize he's time-traveled. Instead, he thinks he's discovered new lands. He and Angela make ideal sparring partners and bedmates: the only problem is that Magnus has taken a vow of celibacy. Despite a daunting number of characters, Hill manages to give each child a unique voice while still keeping the focus on the sexy shenanigans between Magnus and Angela. A subplot involving a nasty neighbor who will do anything to get his hands on the winery is underdeveloped, but, all in all, this is an engaging, hilarious and entirely winsome read.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Very Virile Viking", "price": 6.64, "salesRank": {"Books": 752290}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hghD4QoBL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062019147", "0062019058", "0425222950", "0062019007", "0425213021", "0425217930", "0425230678", "0062019090", "0062019236", "0062019082", "0062019015", "006167351X", "006201904X", "0425237400", "0062019120", "0061673501", "0061673498", "0062019104", "0062019139", "0062210440", "0062273574", "0062064630", "0446612944", "0062064614", "0062210467", "0062019074", "0062019112", "0446612952", "0062273949", "0062064622", "0345543939", "1611942179", "0843949848", "0843946172", "0505521822", "0425233812", "0062317253", "0446616516", "0446612960", "0373778449", "0345543912", "0062107763", "0062219278", "0425266044", "0062107739", "1250041600", "0062219251", "0062078143", "0425271447", "0992278937", "0758265247", "0062078119", "0061934712", "1451693486", "0505519836", "0062078178", "0425259269", "0373777795", "140226979X", "1402264747", "0446616524", "0345543955", "1402237383", "0446616532", "0345519493", "1455519510", "0062019708", "0671702513", "044658309X", "0345533232", "0425267083", "0451465229", "0345519515", "0062223895", "1402237391", "0515154636", "0843944579", "0515154210", "0345519477", "0446583111", "0758284047", "1402237375", "0062068547", "0446561797", "042527294X", "1250017297", "0425272966", "1420100130", "0061118443", "0062034871", "0061229687", "0061344796", "1402264771", "145169346X", "1455514349", "006077407X", "0061965626", "0062031767", "0061965650"], "bought_together": ["0062019147", "0062019058"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062210440", "006167351X", "0425230678", "0425217930"]}}

Overwhelmed by the constant flow of wounded soldiers coming from the French front, battlefield nurse Bess Crawford must now contend with hundreds of influenza patients as well.However, war and disease are not the only killers to strike. Bess discovers, concealed among the dead waiting for burial, the body of an officer who has been murdered. Though she is devoted to all her patients, this soldier's death touches her deeply. Not only did the man serve in her father's former regiment, he was also a family friend.Before she can report the terrible news, Bess falls ill, the latest victim of the flu. By the time she recovers, the murdered officer has been buried, and the only other person who saw the body has hanged himself.

{"asin": "0062004891", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 6-9-In an interesting joint effort, Myers teamed with high school student Workman to produce this novel about a soccer player who runs into trouble helping a friend. Veteran police sergeant Jerry Brown is asked to look into the case of a 13-year-old boy who crashed a car belonging to his friend's father. Brown takes a special interest in the case when he is informed that the boy, Kevin Johnson, is the son of an officer who was killed in the line of duty. As Brown delves more deeply, he begins to suspect that the friend's family has something to hide. He also develops a bond with Kevin, who, although angry and troubled, is basically kindhearted and well-intentioned. Workman wrote the chapters narrated by the boy, and Myers wrote those narrated by Brown. This approach works quite well in terms of narrative voice, as Myers's more polished style reflects an adult perspective, while Workman's less-refined prose seems appropriate to his character's outlook and experience. There is some exciting soccer action, and the interaction between Brown and Kevin is heartwarming, yet natural and unforced. While some may feel that the denouement falls a little flat, the novel should have wide appeal to soccer fans, aspiring writers, and boys from difficult family circumstances who are trying to figure out how to make their way in the world.-Richard Luzer, Fair Haven Union High School, VT (c) Copyright 2010.

{"asin": "0062012487", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "PreS-Gr 2-As in Farm (Scholastic, 2010) and Dance! (HarperCollins, 2001), Cooper takes an uncommon approach to a traditional topic. Here, he replaces the exuberant or troublemaking dog of literary convention with a stolid, aging yellow lab contentedly watching the action occur around him. Emerging one by one from a seaside home, Homer's family invites him along to explore the beach, the market, the field. He gently declines each offer, remaining comfortably on the porch. As, one by one, the family returns with gifts from their wanderings, Homer warmly receives their treasures and enthusiastic accounts. Cooper's loose and exquisite pencil-lined watercolors beautifully portray both the vastness of the nearby ocean and cloud-studded sky-look for one lovely full-spread illustration encompassing the whole family adventuring individually that practically radiates with beachy idyll-and the nuance of Homer's realistically expressive face. After everyone's safe return, the father asks Homer if he needs anything. \"No,\" Homer replies, absorbing the sunset before stretching, entering the house for dinner, and settling into his favorite chair in a wonderful six-paneled spread, \"I have you.\" With short sentences, large font, and the familiar topic, the book seems targeted to a preschool audience, but the autumnal serenity may elude some younger children. However, the appealing illustrations, simple text, and loving but unsaccharine tone will capture many children, especially those with a veteran pet waiting patiently at home.-Robbin E.

With no identification on the body other than an expensive pocket watch, it seems unlikely that Scotland Yard&#x2019;s Inspector Rutledge will be able to get to the bottom of this unusual crime (this was a time when motorcars were still fairly uncommon). But the watch provides a clue, leading Rutledge to a wine-making family, one of whose members has been missing for a while.

After a year of fighting Jack finally walks out,  and Ruby realizes she has let her personal life fall by the wayside while she has built up a successful lingerie company.  Then, while listening to one of Jack's tapes on The Power of Positive Thinking, Ruby is transported back in time and awakens on a Viking ship.  The leader, as luck would have it, looks just like Jack. While Ruby is intrigued by Thork's resemblance to Jack,  Thork is confused by his immediate attraction to Ruby.  Thork feels he must keep his distance, however, as he believes his half-brother will kill her, as he has killed anyone Thork has ever cared for.  Thork's two sons are only alive because they have been placed with another couple as orphans, and their deaths faked.  The boys' mothers were killed as well and now he fears for Ruby's life.  She tells him that even a little time with someone you love is better than none at all.  They are finally married, but their happiness is short lived when Thork's true enemy, Ivar,  kidnaps his oldest son and demands Thork in exchange for him. Tortured while a captive, Thork suffers fatal injuries and although he is rescued, he eventually dies from his injuries.  After Thork dies, Ruby finds herself back in 1993 with a new resolve to save her marriage.  Though it seems to have been some time in the past, it has only been a few hours in the present and Ruby decides to go after Jack.  It takes some sincere effort, but the two are not only able to work things out, but get some good news along the way!The Reluctant Viking is a wonderfully in-depth, ambitious challenge for a first time author, and Ms. Hill pulls it off with style!

{"asin": "0062019805", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Readers weary of the tortured, brooding, all-too-serious vampires that often populate paranormal romance novels will appreciate Sands's (The Loving Daylights, etc.) cheeky, madcap tale about an immortal who finds eternal happiness with his editor. Reclusive Lucern Argeneau, a family biographer who has been classified as a paranormal romance author, is stunned when Kate C. Leever, his new editor at Roundhouse Publishing (read: Dorchester), shows up on his doorstep demanding he make a public appearance to appease his fans. After some urging from the beguiling Kate, he agrees to go to the Romantic Times convention, little knowing that he'll have to contend with adoring fans and a week full of parties and signings. Some of the plot twists verge on the absurd-such as when Luc's codpiece sticks to a tablecloth at a Renaissance ball, or when Kate fells an attacker with a pillow-and Kate's reluctance to admit her feelings for Luc because she assumes she's \"just supper\" to him is aggravating. Still, vampire lovers will find themselves laughing throughout.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Single White Vampire (Argeneau Vampire)", "price": 4.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 246080}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514ll5YtItL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["006201983X", "0062019740", "006077407X", "0060773758", "0060774126", "0061229687", "0061229776", "0061229695", "0061474320", "0061474290", "0061474312", "0061894575", "0061474304", "0061894591", "0061894451", "0062100203", "0062078070", "0062022601", "0062078119", "0062078143", "0062078178", "0843962550", "0060751967", "0060752017", "0061958069", "0061667854", "0062107712", "0061118443", "0061667862", "0061958050", "0061667846", "0061118451", "0061958034", "0062317253", "0062107763", "006111846X", "0061583227", "006134477X", "0062107739", "0061783161", "006178320X", "0061958042", "0062264982", "0062019694", "0062076108", "0425240789", "0062273574", "0061583073", "0451417070", "0061245097", "0425245780", "0062020285", "0373774559", "0062019708", "0061245089", "0061783188", "0425245047", "0062019503", "0061783196", "0061583219", "006201949X", "0061344796", "0425266044", "0062019457", "0515135216", "0062019821", "0062019430", "006201966X", "0061963119", "0062019406", "0062076116", "0061963046", "0843947365", "0373775237", "1416576754", "0061344788", "1467974676", "0062021338", "0373776578", "0062019716", "0062019511", "0425271447", "0425251217", "1416547037", "0062021346", "1416509887", "0373773927", "0062107771", "0062014072", "1416580948", "0373775229", "0373777434", "0373778449", "0425251012", "0373775245", "1451671598", "0373775814", "1439123128", "0373774516", "0986023833"], "bought_together": ["006201983X", "0062019740"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060773758", "0061229776", "0061894451", "0061229687"]}}

{"asin": "0062020153", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "At the start of Liu's first-rate debut, psychically sensitive tourist Dela Reese browses for treasures at Beijing's Dirt Market, where an old woman sells her a riddle box for only one yuan. Surprisingly, when Dela opens the box back in her hotel room, a gorgeous seven-foot-tall warrior appears, bearing 2,000-year-old weapons. The warrior, Hari, has been cursed for two millennia to serve as a slave - bereft of his power to shape-shift into a tiger - to anyone who opens the box. Assassins follow Delilah and Hari from Beijing back home to the U.S., where Dela and Hari soon find themselves in the midst of a war between Chinese crime syndicates. The reappearance of Hari's age-old nemesis, the Magi, who has been searching for Hari since he was imprisoned in the box, jacks up the suspense. The romance between Delilah and Hari tantalizingly builds until it culminates in a sensual love scene. Repetitive references to Hari's great stature fortunately don't detract from the appeal of this striking paranormal romance.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He can&#x2019;t remember where he comes from, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of magical herbs and their uses, and he just does not understand human interaction. As the apprentice to Caleb, the last magician in the magic-steeped Barrow, Oscar doesn&#x2019;t need to worry about how different he is: all he needs to do is collect the herbs, prepare the charms and tinctures, do his chores, and avoid trouble. That changes when a mysterious destructive force begins obliterating anything magical, and the city&#x2019;s perfect children start falling curiously ill. As Oscar and his friend Callie investigate the source of the devastation and seek to protect the Barrow and its inhabitants, they discover a deep, dark secret. And has Oscar discovered why he&#x2019;s so different? Ursu (Breadcrumbs, 2011) also presents a rich world filled with natural magic and a troubling origin story of sacrifice.

{"asin": "0062019309", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a \"Goddess evoking\" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger. At first the ever-practical Joy is ready to dismiss her vision as a product of too much gin and too many vampire romances, but while traveling through the Czech Republic with Roxy, Joy begins to have some second thoughts about her mystery lover because she is suddenly plagued by visions of a lethally handsome stranger. Then, when she and Roxy attend a local GothFaire, Joy meets Raphael Griffin St. John, head of security, and she becomes even more bewildered because the dark and dangerous Raphael seems too close to her dreams for comfort. Readers will gladly give in to the wickedly sharp bite of MacAlister's wit in this temptingly toothsome romance. With its superb characterization and writing that manages to be both sexy and humorous, this contemporary paranormal love story is an absolute delight.John CharlesCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"asin": "0062019694", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "After ignoring his betrothed for more than a decade, Lord Blake Sherwell has finally been coerced by the English king into claiming his bride, the hoydenish Seonaid Dunbar. He reluctantly arrives at her father's Scottish keep only to discover his intended is equally averse to the match and has fled to a convent. Scotland in 1395 is no place for a woman alone, so he grimly sets out to retrieve his errant wife to be, and the rollicking adventure begins. This matched set of warriors--Seonaid has trained since infancy with her father and brother and indeed has her own specially wrought sword--entertains her father's men as well as Sherwell's entourage with their antics, for now Sherwell's interest has been piqued, and he takes up the chase in earnest. Well-placed humor, vividly descriptive passages, and a believable romance between two stubborn but honorable protagonists, together with the added interest generated by the escapades of a host of secondary characters, make Sands' historical romance appealing on many levels.Lynne WelchCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"asin": "0062011251", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In her first novel, poet/critic Williams depicts the story of runaway slave Dessa Rose and a white woman who harbors runaways on her isolated farm. Dessa's story begins when she attacks the master who has killed her husband. Sold to a slave trader from whom she and some companions escape, Dessa is captured and interviewed by a man writing a book on slave rebellions. Her companions free her and, hiding on Miss Rufel's farm, they plot their escape to the West. Dessa's evolving relationship with Miss Rufel speaks volumes about the complex feelings between white and black women then and now. Unfortunately, the initial exposition, alternating between the interviewer and Dessa's dazed flashbacks, is slow-moving and confusing, giving no hint of the richness to come.

{"asin": "0062020161", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. Liu's powerful 10th Dirk &amp; Steele paranormal romance (after 2009's The Fire King) is a satisfying adventure of intense emotion and compelling characters. After a chance beach meeting, young Jenny Jameson and merboy Perrin meet in dreams for years until they find each other in the flesh as adults. Together, they attempt to solve the mystery of a murdered mermaid Guardian and save the world from monsters who wake underneath the sea. Liu provides a delicious treat for those who like their romance based on love, connection, and shared adventures rather than raw lust and conflict. Tension comes from external dangers, and kissing, handholding, and magical dreams overshadow sex.

{"asin": "0062020544", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 5-8-In Storybound (HarperCollins, 2012), 12-year-old Una Fairchild discovers a book that serves as a portal to the land of Story, which is populated by heroes, heroines, princesses in distress, knights in shining armor, wizards, fairies, dragons, and magical spells. Characters like Una who are transported into Story from the land of Readers are called the Written Ins. A foster child, Una has always wondered what happened to her parents and sadly discovers that they were characters in Story who were far from being the good guys. In this book, Una is back in the land of Story, printing broadsides that announce the discovery of the Enemy's evil plot to overtake it. She and her friends send out a call to arms, asking all the characters to join in the resistance movement so that the king of long ago can return and \"happily ever after\" can once again exist. In this story within a story, Una discovers the magic that runs through her veins and plays a critical role in righting past wrongs. Fans of Cornelia Funke's Inkheart (Scholastic, 2002) will undoubtedly notice the similarities, and some might even compare the series to Carla Jablonski and D. J. MacHale's \"The Travelers\" books (S & S). There is enough action to interest reluctant readers.-Sabrina Carnesi, Crittenden Middle School, Newport News, VA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The famed redhead and her Cuban husband, who met as young Hollywood contract players, pioneered TV situation comedy by starring in their own series and founding Desilu Productions, which was responsible for such other hit shows as Star Trek and Mission Impossible . Colleagues, friends and relatives--particularly daughter Lucie Arnaz--contribute to this telling of the team's successes and failures. Lucille's obsessive involvements with her co-stars and children and Desi's alcoholism and womanizing come to stand out in sharp contrast to the zany TV antics of Lucy and Desi, who remain beloved by the viewing public worldwide. The book will disappoint fans, however, due to excessive attention paid to the finances of Desilu Productions.

{"asin": "0062019120", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "What do you get when you take two identical twin Vikings, pair them with some feisty ladies and throw in several large servings of absurdity and sex? The newest Viking romance from Hill (The Very Virile Viking, etc.). Although Hill is known for the fresh, funny, contemporary feel of her Viking romances, readers may overdose on the over-the-top antics she dishes up here. Exiled from their father's estate for their immature ways, Toste and Vagn Ivarsson have joined a band of warring Norsemen in Saxon lands. Just when they decide it's time to grow up and return to their country, a terrible battle finds them separated, each thinking the other dead. The lusty Vikings rebound quickly and soon find themselves chasing after the most unlikely women. Esme, Toste's shapely nurse/novice nun, heats his blood. Vagn, meanwhile, pursues hot-tempered Helga the Homely, the daughter of his Viking rescuer. Vagn lures her into bed many times over, despite her desire to be an independent woman, while Esme and Toste take turns tying each other up and having their way with each other. Each page is bawdier than the next, but Hill doesn't grant her characters much in the way of intelligence. Still, it's hard not to be happy for the \"lackwit\" Viking twins when they're finally reunited.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Known as \"the Great Communicator,\" Ronald Reagan combined the best of small-town values and remarkable virtues with the eloquence and charm that came from a life spent in the public eye. From his early days, Reagan was a leader, whether saving lives as a lifeguard or demonstrating for students' rights as a college undergraduate. His career as a sports broadcaster and later as a leading man in Hollywood paved the way for a career in politics. As governor of California, Reagan earned the respect of world leaders and the American public. But it was as president of the United States that his strength of character, leadership, and love of country were best displayed. His eight years in the Oval Office ushered in remarkable change domestically and brought international peace, prosperity, and freedom.A visual celebration of all that is Ronald Reagan,Ronald Reagan: 100 Yearsis the official centennial publication for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. Inspiring and uplifting, it is a fitting homage to one of America's greatest legends. A foreword by former Senator Howard H.

But the book is much more than a firsthand account of recent events: it is a clear-eyed take on what has been achieved, the triumphs and failings of Afghans and foreigners alike, and why the country is still mired in conflict.

When young telepathic widow Corinne Wentworth walks into the bar where Carpathian Dayan, of the legendary band the Dark Troubadours, is playing, he immediately recognizes her as his lifemate (\"He heard the soft murmur of her voice, and at once his world changed\"). Difficulties lie ahead for the couple, not the least of which is that the men who murdered her husband are hunting her and her sister-in-law, Lisa. Corinne's weak heart is also a major source of conflict.

{"asin": "0062017810", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "PreS-K-A sweet, playful tale about a small panda with an extraordinary knack for inadvertently causing trouble. Chu's parents take him on several outings one day, frequently pausing to check that the youngster doesn't have to sneeze because, as the narrator warns, \"When Chu sneezed, bad things happened.\" Though the dusty books at the library and pepper-infused air of a restaurant don't bring on a sneezing attack, the circus results in one that not only brings down the big-top tent, but also causes pandemonium throughout the town. Despite the simple story and unembellished text, there's more than enough in the art to keep readers engaged. A roly-poly panda in aviator glasses and a green-striped T-shirt, wide-eyed Chu cuts a comically endearing figure as he contorts his body and facial expressions in anticipation of a sneeze. The locations depicted in these richly saturated painted spreads have an old-fashioned flavor, and vintage touches are visible throughout: the pillbox hat his mother sports, card catalogs at the library, a gumball machine at the diner. These prim, orderly settings are the perfect setup for the chaos that Chu introduces, and there's a mischievous sense of humor that results from placing exotic anthropomorphic animals (squids, narwhals, giraffes, wombats) onto these decidedly conventional backdrops. While children will delight in seeing such a tiny creature wreak havoc, the story still concludes on a reassuring note, with Chu's parents gently tucking him in. A small but delightful dose of fun.-Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.  Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

{"asin": "0062019775", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Avelyn is the pride of her parents--lovely, intelligent, sweet tempered, skilled in all pursuits expected of a great lady, and nicely rounded. Unfortunately, her nasty cousins have taunted her so unceasingly for so many years that she feels ugly, fat, and undesirable. A series of humiliating incidents on her wedding day and thereafter has also convinced her new husband, Paen de Gerville, that she is not only frail but accident-prone, and the comical misunderstandings that result lead to more unhappiness for Avelyn. But eleventh-century England is dangerous and demanding, and soon her natural optimism overcomes her feelings of inadequacy, allowing her to take control and succeed as chatelaine of Rumsfeld in spite of the mishaps that continue to plague her. Sands has cleverly woven a suspenseful subplot into this medieval coming-of-age romance, and her characters--including two sets of overanxious but loving parents, a clumsy squire-in-training, and a pet piglet--delight, while her trademark humor and vivid settings enthrall the reader.Lynne WelchCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"asin": "0062017446", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"The first letter arrived on a Monday.\" So begins the masterfully paced thriller from the author of Palindrome , Santa Fe Rules , etc. Young Hollywood actress Chris Callaway is poised at the brink of stardom when her world collapses. Shortly after she begins receiving disquieting letters signed \"Admirer,\" she is nearly blinded in a fall at the construction site of her new Malibu home. As Admirer becomes a menacing stalker, sending gifts and a gruesome photo and calling on the phone, Chris is stoutly guarded by her best friend and confidant, hairdresser Danny Devere. Also on duty is Beverly Hills police detective and stalker expert Jon Larsen. The Admirer soon targets the threesome in escalating attacks that become grisly and, then, murderous. Meanwhile, Larsen races to investigate the sinister suspects that emerge from the cadre of subcontractors on the Malibu construction team. Woods's style is lean and staccato, if unsubtle, and he's a pro at turning up the suspense, which is increased here as romance blooms between the cop and the rising star. 100,000 first printing; major ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Dead Eyes", "price": 8.0, "salesRank": {"Books": 86726}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618JztoxXEL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062017500", "0061987336", "006198731X", "0061987328", "0062017543", "0451233468", "045121580X", "045121594X", "0451236556", "0061711632", "0451227743", "0451234308", "0061711578", "006171190X", "0451214625", "0451211561", "0061711861", "0061711918", "0061987301", "0451232933", "0451466861", "0061711926", "0451210158", "0451213173", "0451208080", "0451205626", "0451206711", "0451204115", "0451229517", "0061711934", "045141439X", "0451208811", "0451237854", "045121319X", "0451215761", "0451220846", "0451225597", "0451227751", "0451221656", "0451414373", "0451218701", "045123877X", "0451235347", "0451236351", "0451223608", "0451414381", "0399164162", "0451228561", "0451226712", "0451234456", "0451224787", "0399164154", "0451229649", "0451229630", "0399164146", "0399159878", "0399169121", "0399169113", "039915986X", "0399159843", "0060177756", "B005X4APW6", "B0072Q3HUU", "0399161112", "0060177144", "B002VPE9HC", "0060179112", "B002YNS12K", "0399158863", "0399154906", "B0072Q1VAI", "0451232704", "039916149X", "1455521515", "0399157344", "0425260992", "0399153683", "0399157115", "1455515957", "0425155722", "0399171231", "0446574724", "1476745005", "1455550647", "B0072Q3ZDY", "0440246334", "0399150900", "0060177764", "045141411X", "0060176660", "1455515892", "045121756X", "0440246202", "0425135020", "0399172920", "0446573094", "0399167293"], "bought_together": ["0062017500", "006198731X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["045121580X", "0061987328", "0062017543", "0062017500"]}}
{"asin": "006201949X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The eighth entry in Feehan's popular vampire series (Dark Legend; Dark Fire) follows the same formula as her previous books a Carpathian (an immortal vampire hunter) meets his \"lifemate,\" binds himself to her through an ancient ritual involving blood-letting and hot sex, and together they battle the undead. This time around, Feehan spices up her stale story line with her smart and spunky heroine, police officer Jaxon Montgomery. Former Navy SEAL Tyler Drake, Jaxon's maniacal stepfather, has made it his mission to kill anyone she befriends, which has made her equally determined not to form any close ties. Nevertheless, she can't help feeling intimately connected to Carpathian Lucian Daratrazanoff, who takes her into his care when she is shot while searching a warehouse. Convinced that Jaxon is his life mate, Lucian binds himself to her and brings her \"over to the Carpathian race.\" Together, Jaxx and Lucian destroy vampires, battle Drake and read each other's minds. Their romance is heartfelt and convincingly portrayed. Less believable, however, is the fact that Jaxx doesn't object to her Carpathian transformation, especially considering her independent nature. Nevertheless, Feehan's newest is a skillful blend of supernatural thrills and romance that is sure to entice readers who can stomach the occasional gory scene.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Dark Guardian (Dark Series)", "price": 6.72, "salesRank": {"Books": 192675}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pds5U8daL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062019503", "0062019457", "0062021346", "0062021338", "0515135216", "0062019406", "0062019511", "0515138851", "0062019481", "0515140880", "0062019430", "0515143545", "0425217833", "0515146994", "0515145351", "0515149993", "0515148431", "0062219022", "0843956879", "0515151106", "0062019554", "0425243257", "0515151564", "0843951702", "0515136964", "0062021362", "0515154237", "0425270793", "0062021354", "0515154628", "0425255808", "0749937491", "0425268330", "0505524503", "B008SLB5D4", "074347628X", "0515135968", "0425217094", "0843955287", "042520751X", "0425271447", "0515138096", "0515143189", "0515145068", "0515146234", "0515139769", "0515149330", "042520863X", "0515151548", "0515144282", "0515136824", "0515146471", "0515141542", "051513953X", "0515147907", "0515151556", "0515142166", "0515149217", "B0053U7B9A", "0515145807", "1939193893", "0515147605", "0515148245", "0515142611", "0425223434", "051514956X", "0515154636", "0425236773", "0425211673", "1410444562", "0062019805", "0749937483", "0425236595", "074993784X", "006077407X", "006201983X", "0061229776", "0062019740", "0061474304", "0060774126", "0061474312", "0373774559", "1416580956", "1439123128", "0373774613", "0061474290", "1416576754", "1416580948", "0061894575", "0373777434", "0373773927", "0749937858", "0061229695", "0061474320", "0062100203", "0373777752", "0373778449", "0373776985", "141654707X", "0373775814"], "bought_together": ["0062019503", "0062019457"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062019503", "0062019511", "0062019406", "0062019430"]}}

When she awakens, she learns that not only is she dead, but she is also in the Attesa Hotel, a pseudo purgatory for murdered teenagers. Before she can get her key to move through the Red Door to the next dimension, she must solve her own murder. Charlotte quickly comes to terms with her death and begins learning the \"rules\" from Nancy and Lorna. Calling themselves the Dead Girls Detective Agency, the girls begin ruling out potential suspects by porting to Charlotte's funeral and high school and possessing the living, including Charlotte's old boyfriend, David, and the cheerleaders who are currently pursuing him. As the girls, along with the mysterious dead boy Edison, work to solve the murder, Charlotte's heart is broken by David's new romances but is quickly mended as Edison proves to be a potential love interest. Readers will anticipate but welcome the story's satisfying ending. The characters' voices are virtually indistinguishable and the plot moves slowly. However, readers are likely to forgive these shortcomings along with a couple of plot inconsistencies in favor of a light, easy read sprinkled with fashion, mystery, and romance.-Lynn Rashid, Marriotts Ridge High School, Marriottsville, MD&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

{"asin": "0062021877", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "InBlindsighted(book one of an anticipated three featuring Grant  County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton), first-time novelist  Karin Slaughter comes out swinging in true medical examiner fashion. That is to  say, covered with blood from the get-go.Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara  onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively  clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she  groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara  managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her  head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped.Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of  being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the  local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't  stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably,  still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton.  Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena  Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister.And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound,  from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend,  to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had  been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon  becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has  faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with  a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine. Characters are nicely if somewhat obviously  drawn, the plot is inventive, and the narrative's pacing quickens the pulse  straight to the cliff-hanging denouement. And really, what more can you ask of  an ME thriller?--Michael Hudson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Blindsighted", "price": 3.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 62977}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wA9YfGs7L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062021885", "0062021893", "0062021907", "0440242916", "0440242932", "0440242924", "0440244455", "0440244471", "0345528212", "0345528522", "0440244463", "0345539494", "0345539478", "B007K4OHMQ", "0099538652", "0345547497", "0345540859", "009942178X", "0099462257", "B001JFKGWC", "0553588095", "1250038006", "B0073N9PNA", "0688174582", "0553578693", "B0051CBBIC", "0345447840", "0553578685", "0525953086", "0345544242", "0060567104", "0385339461", "0553588087", "1477823476", "1250005965", "0553591924", "0375704965", "1420125052", "1420125060", "1420129074", "0553584537", "0099462265", "0758258593", "0451465849", "0553588079", "0307279952", "0553591916", "0553576801", "038533947X", "1420125079", "0062366920", "0451413431", "1420118528", "1250005973", "B0073N9P94", "1420106783", "0553591908", "1420133713", "055358359X", "0345502760", "1250038022", "055339052X", "0345520416", "1250005957", "0553576798", "0385341962", "0345520394", "1420125788", "0553384791", "1610530136", "1250035058", "0451417283", "0345502752", "0440245907", "0553583581", "0061808385", "0143113496", "1420125036", "1416537732", "0688174590", "0345511697", "006224454X", "1420134620", "1455527602", "1420100939", "0451414098", "0345495047", "1611734665", "0345495020", "1590171942", "1455527580", "0553572210", "1420118544", "0515153656", "0345495039", "142011851X", "0345485238", "1455527653", "1420118536"], "bought_together": ["0062021885", "0062021893"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0345539494", "0345528212", "0440242924", "0345528522"]}}

I wanted to live inside its pages, where I could imagine not just the scenes themselves, but the cameras, the lights, the actors reading their lines off to the sides of the set. Main character Jude Keffy-Horn--named after a Beatles song by his adoptive hippy parents--spends his high school days in small town Vermont getting high with his best friend Teddy, waiting to turn 16, when he can legally drop out. When Teddy dies of an overdose on the last day of 1987, Jude is sent to live with his pot-dealer father in New York City. Jude soon falls in with a group of straight edge Hari Krishnas, where his commitment to abstinence in all forms--drugs, sex, meat--becomes an addiction itself. Jude struggles to create an identity amongst the extreme movements taking root downtown, while his parents struggle to understand their son&#x2019;s rejection of their free love culture. Author Eleanor Henderson's meticulous research into the straight edge movement in the late 1980s has opened a door to a piece of history handled with love, care, and incredibly unforgettable characters.  --Alexandra Foster", "title": "Ten Thousand Saints: A Novel", "price": 10.23, "salesRank": {"Books": 680126}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s3vYMTm%2BL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0307263991", "0307276686", "1594203970", "193636574X", "0385343841", "0307477479", "0316126675", "0307957128", "0805097457", "0316055433", "0316126691", "0307947726", "0812993969", "0316176486", "0062065246", "0385351399", "1594488398", "0679644199", "0307962695", "1594204497", "030758836X", "1400068312", "0307959880", "1400043131", "0812993802", "0345803450", "0312576463", "0316223239", "0061928178", "0142418471", "0316036315"], "bought_together": ["0316126675", "0307477479"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004P5OOCQ", "0316204269", "0385343841", "0316055433"]}}

{"asin": "0062019740", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A prequel of sorts to Sands's paranormal comedy, Single White Vampire, this lightweight romantic romp shoots for the easy laugh and often misses. The allure of vampires lies in their strength and seeming invulnerability, but Etienne Argeneau, this book's bloodsucking hero, is curiously incompetent when it comes to dispatching a crazed mortal named Pudge who's intent on lopping his head off. Twice, Pudge manages to injure Etienne to the point where he ends up in the morgue under coroner Rachel Garrett's care. But when Rachel gets in the way of attempt number three, Etienne rescues her in the only way he knows how-by turning her into a vampire. The story moves from mildly amusing to ridiculous when Rachel, in denial, insists that she's merely having a \"wet dream\" involving a sexy man who thinks he's a vampire. There's little tension between Etienne and Rachel, sexual or otherwise. Instead, Sands stretches the plot with conflicts stemming from minor misunderstandings. Her attempts at hip dialogue also fall flat (at one point, a 200-year-old vampire compliments Rachel by saying, \"You're a happening chick, dudette!\"). Those who enjoyed Sands's previous paranormal comedy of errors may eke a little enjoyment from these pages, but this isn't something vampire fans will want to sink their teeth into.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062021354", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Best known for her vampire romances (Dark Guardian, etc.), Feehan adds a gothic twist to a classic fairy tale in this eerie and engrossing 19th-century romance. In a desperate attempt to save her brother, Lucca, from the evil clutches of the grasping lord who has imprisoned him, Isabella Vernaducci, a courageous but impoverished noblewoman, ventures into the Alps to search for the elusive and dangerous Don Nicolai DeMarco, believing him the only man powerful enough to save Lucca. To her surprise, Nicolai offers her a deal: he will aid her if she consents to be his bride. Isabella agrees before learning of the DeMarco curse which condemns the DeMarco men to be seen as \"the beast\" and prophesies that Nicolai will \"rip the heart\" from the one he loves. Suspense simmers in the DeMarco keep, where chilling cries are heard long into the night and Nicolai's \"pet\" lions roam. Though the relationship between Nicolai and Isabella is overwrought at times he frequently tries to save her from himself by attempting to send her away they're a perfectly matched pair in terms of temperament, and their steamy sex scenes heat up the pages. With its guileless heroine, masterful hero and mystical overtones, Feehan's inspired retelling is likely to garner her the attention she deserves.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Lair of the Lion", "price": 2.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 610352}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rRicLf7BL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062021362", "0062019503", "0062019511", "0062219022", "0062021346", "006201949X", "0062019457", "0515151556", "0062019406", "0062019430", "0515135216", "0062021338", "042520751X", "0515146234", "0062019481", "0515151564", "0515138851", "0515149330", "0515151548", "0515143545", "0515146994", "0515149993", "0515154237", "0515147907", "0515140880", "0425270793", "0515148431", "0515145351", "0425217833", "0515136824", "0515151106", "051514956X", "0843956879", "0425268330", "074347628X", "0515138096", "0425243257", "042520863X", "0515135968", "0843951702", "0425271447", "0062019554", "0515154636", "0515148245", "0515139769", "0515145068", "0515143189", "0515144282", "0515145807", "051513953X", "0515146471", "0515142611", "0515149217", "0515142166", "0515141542", "0515147605", "0425255808", "0515154628", "0515136964", "0425236773", "0425251217", "0505524503", "0373776985", "0373777434", "0425245780", "1250012651", "0062107739", "0515132764", "0425245047", "0843955287", "0986023833", "1467974676", "006178320X", "0373778449", "0425266044", "0425240789", "0989990729", "0062078143", "1416580956", "0451417224", "1451650051", "0062078119", "0062019740", "0373775237", "0451417232", "1451683308", "0451238834", "0425251012", "1491089288", "0451236440", "0451234340", "0312550006", "0062078178", "0373774559", "0373776578", "0312546602", "0061894575", "0373775490", "0062076108", "0743482964"], "bought_together": ["0062021362"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0515154628", "0515154237", "0062019503", "0062021362"]}}

{"asin": "0062023020", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This fantasy-romance debut features faerie king Rain Tairen Soul, a man tormented by age-old grief: a thousand years ago, the woman he loved was slain in battle, and in his rage he laid waste to half the world. Now his people are dying out and the evil mages of Eld are rising again. When Rain hears the call of his lost soul mate, Ellysetta, he journeys to the neighboring kingdom to find her; when he claims a woodcarver's daughter as his mate, he scandalizes the nobility of her country and rouses the interest of Eld's wicked wizards, who come seeking her in order to get at Rain. The first book in a series, much of this volume is devoted to establishing the characters and their world, at the expense of plot. Though the extended courtship between Rain and Ellysetta can grow tedious, the story moves well enough to hold readers' interest and draw them into the sequel (due in November), which should advance the plot significantly. A promising start, this series should have great appeal for fans of fantasy and will likely reward romance readers for whom patience is not a problem.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062012614", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The evocative title tells it all and hints at the tone of sensationalism that pervades this book. Those familiar with the earlier work of Ehrman, a distinguished professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of more than 20 books including Misquoting Jesus, will not be surprised at the content of this one. Written in a manner accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman argues that many books of the New Testament are not simply written by people other than the ones to whom they are attributed, but that they are deliberate forgeries. The word itself connotes scandal and crime, and&nbsp;it appears on nearly every page. Indeed, this book takes on an idea widely accepted by biblical scholars: that writing in someone else's name was common practice and perfectly okay in ancient times. Ehrman argues that it was not even then&nbsp;considered acceptable&mdash;hence, a forgery. While many readers may wish for more evidence of&nbsp;the charge, Ehrman's introduction to the arguments and debates among different religious communities during the first few centuries and among&nbsp;the early Christians themselves, though not the book's main point, is especially valuable.

{"asin": "0062018930", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Cornwall's luscious Regency romance has just the right blend of mystery, manners, and passion. Isobel Maitland, the countess of Ashdown, is the epitome of a respectable widow, but at a masked ball, she takes the name Yasmina and allows herself to dally with Phineas Archer, the notorious marquess of Blackwood. A spy for the English crown, Phineas has perfected his reputation as a rogue, but soon he's seeking \"Yasmina\" as desperately as he seeks a smuggler with ties to Napoleon, while Isobel endures her wicked, social-climbing relatives and tries to control her passions. Once Phineas discovers Yasmina's identity, he resolves to find a way to convince her they must marry&mdash;unless she's conspiring with the smuggler. Though Isobel is at first frustratingly passive, she becomes a spirited leading lady. With truly nefarious villains, plenty of action, and a dash of glamour, this tome is a seductive read.

Ellysetta Baristani, a woodcarver's daughter with unexplained magical gifts, must find the solution with the aid of her recently discovered truemate, Rain Tairen Soul, the Fey king tormented by his past misdeeds. Wilson peels back layers of secrets surrounding the evil mages of Eld and their schemes to destroy the Tairen and the Fey, but the revelations never overwhelm the emotional intensity of Ellysetta and Rain's developing relationship or diminish the textured beauty of the writing.

Ellysetta Baristani and her betrothed Fey lord, returning hero Rain Tairen Soul, are days away from their wedding, but the wicked Eld lords are drawing ever closer to locating Ellysetta, whose magic they hope to use for their own ends. As the intrigues of the Eld plot ripple throughout the court, Ellysetta wrestles with personal demons and the mysterious power within her. Meanwhile, tensions on the country's borders mount as the specter of war draws nearer. Wilson jumps back into her tale without skipping a beat, expanding her world with finesse while boldly taking her story in entirely unexpected directions. As Ellysetta comes into her own as a proper heroine, driving the story toward its breath-taking conclusion, gratified fans may find their elation giving way to anxiety, as the wait for the next volume will be considerably longer.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062023578", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 2 Up-After plugging the books in the Pinkalicious franchise, Kann instructs readers in cake-decorating techniques for more than 20 projects. Recipes for homemade frosting and cake, including gluten-free variants, are included, most requiring brand-specific products, though reasonable substitutions are sometimes provided. Readers are also encouraged to use prepackaged mixes and frosting as the book's slant is heavily on decorating, not baking. Templates for some recipes are provided, as are source lists for procuring supplies since many ingredients are only available in specialty shops. While marketed to an elementary school audience, it is obvious quite early on that the book's actually for experienced cake decorators. Though beautifully impressive, these creations are not practical for even the average layperson. The basics of cooking with children and kitchen safety are suspiciously absent, while hand washing is not even mentioned until rather far along. Symbolic bubbles containing ideas for child involvement are brought to readers' attention, a feature inconsistently executed and questionable in usefulness. Some bubbles are absent of ideas, while others contain tasks far too simplistic to balance the complexity of the recipes. For those wanting to introduce kids to baking or to enliven the world of Pinkalicious, this volume is far too sophisticated. For adult collections, it is purely a secondary purchase, and entirely unnecessary for juvenile collections.-Rebecca Gueorguiev, New York Public Library&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.  Library Journal.

{"asin": "0062021893", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In the coldly captivating tradition of Cornwell and Reichs, Slaughter (Blindsighted; Kisscut) returns to Grant County, Ga., to offer a third installment in the adventures of smalltown pediatrician and part-time medical examiner Sara Linton. Called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a male Grant Tech student, Sara brings along her pregnant sister, Tessa, who wanders away from the scene and is brutally attacked. The distraught Sara must work side by side with her ex-husband, Det. Jeffrey Tolliver, whom she loves despite his past infidelity, but it's Lena Adams, formerly a cop and now a campus security guard, whose story the novel follows most closely. Still mourning the murder of her sister and recovering from her own torture and rape by the same man, Lena is looked on with suspicion by her ex-boss, Jeffrey. With reason: she's hiding a few key facts. The dead boy's mother is her therapist and Lena is involved with an abusive young man with a shady past. Campus gossip Richard Carter further confuses investigators; meanwhile, police discover the bodies of two more students, their deaths potentially suicides but more likely murder. Slaughter provides grisly variations on the themes of sibling rivalry, sexual abuse and campus politics in a story not for the faint of heart. Readers who can stomach gruesome details and like fitting together multiple stories of physical and psychological abuse will savor the way Slaughter can evoke sympathy for perverse, even criminal, behavior by tracing its origins, and those who make it through the complexities and the gore will be rewarded with a satisfyingly chilling ending.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "A Faint Cold Fear", "price": 5.69, "salesRank": {"Books": 126144}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qkPah558L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062021885", "0062021907", "0062021877", "0440242916", "0440242932", "0440242924", "0440244455", "0440244471", "0345528212", "0440244463", "0345528522", "0345539494", "B007K4OHMQ", "0099462257", "0345539478", "0345547497", "0345540859", "0099538652", "B0051CBBIC", "1611734665", "B0073N9PNA", "0385339461", "009942178X", "0553578693", "0060567104", "1250038006", "0345544242", "0099462265", "1250005965", "0345520394", "0099421771", "1420133713", "1250005957", "0553588087", "0553588095", "0525953086", "0062366920", "0345511697", "B0073N9P94", "1250005973", "1250038022", "0451465849", "0553584537", "0345502760", "0451413431", "1420118528", "0553591908", "0553584529", "0553591924", "0345520416", "0553578685", "0553804561", "0345495047", "0688174590", "0553576798", "0099550288", "0345476980", "1420134620", "0758258593", "0553576801", "1420125788", "038533947X", "1420125060", "0553591916", "0345477006", "0451235150", "0688174574", "0451414101", "0345495039", "0345502752", "0553588079", "0345485238", "0451465547", "1420130358", "0553583581", "0553804553", "0345495020", "055358359X", "0345458923", "1420125036", "0446612804", "0399162380", "0345447840", "0553593803", "0671016768", "0525953884", "0385341962", "1250035058", "1594134553", "0345447867", "0399157344", "034545894X", "1420118544", "142011851X", "0451414098", "055359043X", "0345549627", "0553591754", "0345480236"], "bought_together": ["0062021885", "0062021907"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062021877", "0345528522", "0345539494", "0440242924"]}}

Yet vampires are a source of rich inspiration to visual artists as well, and this collection reveals their work in all its gruesome glory.From the elegant beauties of Victoria Frances to the decaying savages of Anne Stokes, from the more whimsical caricatures of Delphine Levesqe Demers to Jo Chen&#8217;s renditions of Buffy the Vampire Slayer,Vampire Art Nowshowcases the varying representations of this legendary figure. The book illustrates the vampire in his or her many moods: either wooing lovers with a hypnotic stare, biting long necks (willing and unwilling), or staring straight at the viewer as if ready to bound off the page in a nocturnal frenzy. By presenting multiple artists&#8217; takes on what it means to be a vampire, this collection illustrates how one cultural icon can vary so greatly across different cultures, classes, media, and artistic aesthetics.No other supernatural creature has captured our collective imagination quite like the vampire andVampire Art Nowis the perfect compendium to pay homage to that tradition.

While the setting is thoroughly modern, the drama feels as ancient and inevitable as a Greek myth. I read this book with white-knuckled urgency, and finished it in tears.

This time Taylor confronts head-on faith and, most significantly, the dark night of the soul. But really this is a meditation on darkness itself&#x2014;more a journal, she emphasizes, than a manual. What does Taylor mean by darkness? Darkness, she writes, is &#x201C;shorthand for anything that scares me.&#x201D; That could include something as profound as the absence of God to the fear of dementia to the loss of family and friends, as well as that &#x201C;nagging&#x201D; question of &#x201C;what it will feel like to die.&#x201D; She recounts how she became impatient with church teachings that accentuated the light while denying the existence of darkness, and comments on the difference between faith and belief, certainty and trust. An elegant writer with the common touch, Taylor is always a wonderful guide to the spiritual world, and this book is no exception. Here she encourages us to turn out the lights and embrace the spiritual darkness, for it is in the dark, she maintains, that one can truly see. --June Sawyers", "title": "Learning to Walk in the Dark", "price": 12.74, "salesRank": {"Books": 1013}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pQy7fMPWL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061370479", "0060872632", "0664239285", "1561011673", "1594735425", "1616367571", "0664228860", "0062269976", "1455514004", "1594632588", "1561011428", "156101169X", "0061370460", "1561011576", "0060771747", "0470907754", "1455527084", "0802870724", "1616367016", "1561011894", "0062230530", "0809148676", "0830841148", "1455523097", "156101110X", "1594631298", "1561011622", "0664239145", "0374534373", "0829820027", "0835813630", "0664239900", "0281070350", "1590301013", "0060750553", "0819229105", "0687058872", "1587433621", "066423853X", "0804139148", "1610975359", "0310339162", "0827235216", "0802871143", "0062203568", "1616361573", "1118303598", "0061875708", "006223496X", "0664259626", "0802870996", "0553380117", "1118428560", "0061561010", "1577316037", "1626980691", "0060957263", "1426758235", "0806637110", "0835810445", "145554731X", "0470481668", "0830841156", "0310275962", "1557255121", "080914011X", "080287097X", "006202423X", "0814633838", "0867166592", "1601425325", "1879215497", "0824519507", "1901557014", "1626980292", "0802869599", "0664238149", "0800634543", "0664237967", "1557255326", "0684863138", "0664235034", "0664259642", "0307960536", "0664238378", "0385522274", "0664231624", "1426749503", "0801065194", "0061144894", "1608682692", "0824521153", "1616366575", "0800698975", "0814635687", "0664238041", "1595553673", "0867160985", "1594710872"], "bought_together": ["0061370479", "0060872632"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060872632", "0061370479", "1616367571", "1616367016"]}}
{"asin": "0062021397", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Barney follows his Thriller Award&ndash;finalist debut, 2011's The Genesis Key, with an engrossing standalone that combines biblical history and modern science. In 1959, while a group of scientists were conducting a secret experiment at an underground lab in Thurmond, W. Va., a serious accident occurred. President Eisenhower ordered the lab sealed and records of its existence expunged. In the present day, the NSA notices activity at the site and calls in assistant security auditor Mike Califano and CIA agent Ana Thorne to investigate.

Martin&#8217;s wisdom and wit, we put ourselves in the exact moment and location of Jesus and try and picture what it must have been like for both Jesus and those around Him.&#8221; (Stuart's Study Blog)&#8220;The more personal and the more subjective and even the more chatty the account of this pilgrimage becomes, the closer we draw, even without realizing it, to its divine-human subject.&#8221; (Peter Milward, SJ,St. Austin's Review)&#8220;The blend of distilled scholarship and narrative is infectious. Travelogue, spirituality and theological reflection combine with wit and human insight.&#8221; (The Tablet)&#8220;[Jesus] blends Bible study, spiritual reflection, personal memoir and travel writing in a way that (mercifully) differs from the classically dull, dry volumes on the life of Christ.&#8221; (Busted Halo)An inspirational memoir that stands as a fresh perspective on Jesus with Martin&#8217;s own travel narrative and a Bible study that is scholarly and inspirational, this book is perfectly pitched for general readers with his fluid, magazine-style prose- definitely a &#8220;mash-up&#8221; of styles, but Martin makes it work! (ReadTheSpirit)A treasure...a wise and entertaining book that should appeal to the spiritual pilgrim in all of us, no matter what the faith and no matter whether believer or nonbeliever. (Chicago Tribune)&#8220;Jesus: A Pilgrimageis the Jesus book for smart people who are seeking to understand the singular person of Jesus of Nazareth through the illuminated lens of Father Martin&#8217;s intelligent, funny, prayerful and profound faith.&#8221; (Paul Raushenbush, Executive Religion Editor forThe Huffington Post)&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to feel that [Jesus: A Pilgrimage] might be a &#8216;must have&#8217; for Christians who want a more rounded, personal experience of Christ. Or for those who don&#8217;t understand the &#8220;Christian thing&#8221; and would like some general context of their own.&#8221; (Happy Catholic Blog)&#8220;Part travelog, part biblical commentary, part memoir, part meditation &#8230; This will appeal to readers (not just Catholics) seeking an introduction to the Gospels that is personal but rooted in serious scholarship.&#8221; (Library Journal)&#8220;It takes a &#8216;human one&#8217; to write well about the consummate &#8216;Human One,&#8217; Jesus. And James Martin does that very well!

Like his father, an active-duty soldier stationed in Afghanistan, seventh-grader Riley Mack defends \"those who cannot defend themselves.\" With a group of other \"known troublemakers,\" he orchestrates, and carries out, elaborate capers to thwart bullies and seek justice. When a lost dog leads the crew to a cruel puppy mill run by the town's crooked police chief, Riley and his pals must pull off their most difficult and dangerous rescue mission yet. The mood is madcap, with cartoon characters taking part in far-fetched situations. Over-the-top, cheeky dialogue comes fast and furious, to the likely delight of many readers. This sort of goofiness will play well to a read-aloud audience.

In 1666, teenage Kendra relates the horror of watching her family die from a plague, halted only when she becomes aware of her own magic and heals her remaining brother. Starving, they set out for a new life and find themselves at a gingerbread house. Sound familiar? Flinn twists more fairy tales into this engaging, time-jumping tale as Kendra reflects on helping&#x2014;and harming&#x2014;those around her. The Little Mermaid rescues a Titanic passenger. The Princess and the Pea takes place at Versailles. But the showstopper is a clever spin on Cinderella, the pieces hovering just above the puzzle until they fall brilliantly into place in a satisfying and surprising retelling in contemporary Florida. Kendra&#x2019;s chatty first-person asides can be jarring next to the larger sections filled with a rich storyteller tone. Regardless, the inventive takes on the traditional will please fans of Flinn and fairy tales alike and leave them eager for Kendra&#x2019;s next volume.

Although the forces of Invierne were successfully driven back, the outer perimeter of the city still burns. Elisa is now queen of Joya d'Arena, and the crown is proving to be a heavy burden in more ways than one. The Inviernos still seek to capture her to manipulate the power of the Godstone she bears. There is massive civil unrest, and there are those at court who seek to undermine her rule. Although her husband has only been dead a few months, she is being pressured to remarry to secure an alliance with one of the noble houses in the kingdom. After several attempts are made on her life, she sets off on a perilous quest that is part of the fulfillment of her destiny as the bearer. As in the first book, Elisa's narration conveys a sense of immediacy. Carson has created vivid, palpable settings and complex multifaceted characters, and delivers a fast-paced novel that is emotionally charged, suspenseful, and filled with plot twists.

Some will be familiar to many: the 1972 Andes crash of an airplane carrying a Uruguayan rugby team (chronicled in the book and movie, Alive); Chris McCandless&#xFFFD; solo hike into the Alaskan wilderness (subject of the book and movie, Into the Wild). Others less familiar are no less fascinating, such as the plight of the Karluk, a ship that, during the 1913 Canadian Arctic Expedition, was trapped several months in an ice pack. Stroud approaches the stories practically: here&#xFFFD;s what these people did, here&#xFFFD;s what they should have done, here&#xFFFD;s what you should think about doing if you&#xFFFD;re ever in a similar situation. He offers intelligent tips&#xFFFD;if you&#xFFFD;re traveling somewhere remote, tell people where you&#xFFFD;re going, take a well-stocked survival kit, and keep a cool head if you get lost&#xFFFD;and he does an excellent job of putting readers into the situations he&#xFFFD;s discussing, making us feel the cold or the panic or the sheer desperation. --David Pitt", "title": "Will to Live: Dispatches from the Edge of Survival", "price": 11.04, "salesRank": {"Books": 315080}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X30VSnMZL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061373516", "1586852345", "B008BBUWMG", "B002C94PY4", "142360105X", "B008BKQFN2", "B001URA5WA", "B000O7862S", "0762440643", "B001CIOCNA", "0762448180", "1551051222", "1440318743", "B00CS3P8WM", "1440218307", "0061733199", "0936070129", "B008BBVGHG", "B0085ZDGEY", "0756690382", "1440238057", "0340898259", "0873515897", "1569767084", "0393326152", "B004TNWD40", "0060898771", "B0001JXP5M", "0882405136", "0062124137", "B0001IX7OW", "1579122213", "B0010O748Q", "145970696X", "1620873613", "B004X7VRG2", "1610048601", "B00LVDZDXY", "0873499670", "0340829710", "B006QF3TW4", "B007BF50O8", "1594853665", "074345314X", "0452295831", "1569756503", "1616085541", "B004WO9OR0", "1440333548", "B004TE6O2G", "B004TORQ5A", "B003LDKNZ0", "B005LW4J04", "B00CHHSVJ6", "1423632311", "0762780703", "0451238079", "B000OR115W", "061851743X", "156975781X", "B00EVX5OLC", "B00FHRADQ2", "1569759294", "B005NGMJLY", "1612431151", "1583551271", "1933665572", "B000B8FW0Y", "B0046DDU18", "0878423591", "B000O8OTNC", "B008CL24SA", "0967512395", "B004412IHE", "0425105725", "0763631205", "156975599X", "B004410NYO", "0982556276", "B00816PZ8W", "0922273227", "B00664KXGA", "B000GCRWCG", "061559283X", "B00029EWYY", "1602391483"], "bought_together": ["0061373516", "1586852345"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061373516", "1586852345", "142360105X", "0061733199"]}}

{"asin": "006202468X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Product DescriptionPrue McKeel&rsquo;s life is ordinary. At least until her baby brother is abducted by a murder of crows. And then things get really weird.You see, on every map of Portland, Oregon, there is a big splotch of green on the edge of the city labeled &ldquo;I.W.&rdquo; This stands for &ldquo;Impassable Wilderness.&rdquo; No one&rsquo;s ever gone in&mdash;or at least returned to tell of it.And this is where the crows take her brother.So begins an adventure that will take Prue and her friend Curtis deep into the Impassable Wilderness. There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much bigger as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness.A wilderness the locals call Wildwood.Wildwoodis a spellbinding tale full of wonder, danger, and magic that juxtaposes the thrill of a secret world and modern city life. Original and fresh yet steeped in classic fantasy, this is a novel that could have only come from the imagination of Colin Meloy, celebrated for his inventive and fantastic storytelling as the lead singer of the Decemberists. With dozens of intricate and beautiful illustrations by award-winning artist Carson Ellis,Wildwoodis truly a new classic for the twenty-first century.AWildwoodPlaylist by Colin Meloy &amp; Carson Ellis\"Ramble On\"by Led ZeppelinColin Meloy: I remember reading an interview with Evan Dando from the Lemonheads right around the time the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, bemoaning the fact that the director hadn&rsquo;t included asingleZeppelin song in the movie. I tend to agree; I mean, how rad would it&rsquo;ve been after that dramatic ending inThe Return of the King, with all its royal celebrations and slo-mo montages&mdash;the screen goes black and those monster riffs of &ldquo;Immigrant Song&rdquo; kick in? Mind-blowing. So much incredible music in the 60s and 70s was directly fueled by mid-century fantasy fiction, something thatWildwoodowes much to; I feel it would be deeply remiss here not to include a little Zepp.\"Marching Song\"by Esben and the WitchColin Meloy: That said, when I was deep in my preadolescent reverie of fantasy and sci-fi, my friends and I would meet every weekend at someone&rsquo;s house to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There. Confession made. And as everyone knows, the best Dungeon Masters always partnered up their biggest action scenarios with music. While I think it may have been de rigueur to blast Zeppelin or Hawkwind for some folks, I considered myself to be somewhat of a sophisticate. Joy Division was perfect music for a slow, suspenseful crawl through a gelatinous cube-infested grotto. The Legendary Pink Dots added an extra dimension to a party&rsquo;s first encounter with some weird, reclusive nemesis in a castle tower. An Enchantress might appear to &ldquo;Under Ice&rdquo; by Kate Bush or anything from Siouxsie&rsquo;s output. When I first heard this song from Brighton, England&rsquo;s Esben and the Witch (even the name is evocative of those days) I imagined a new generation of over-imaginative ten-year-olds pairing their fantastical ramblings with the drowning rains and empty plains of this song.\"Take It Easy\"by Hopeton LewisColin Meloy: Switching gears, here. Rocksteady, a kind of precursor to the reggae explosion of the 70s, was a beautiful, thoughtful, random amalgam of classic R&amp;B and traditional Jamaican rhythms. It&rsquo;s clearly the kind of music that is birthed out of necessity; a bunch of poor kids in the slums of Kingston figuring out for themselves how to re-create the sounds that they were hearing over crappy radio speakers: Sam Cooke, Ben E. King, and Sam &amp; Dave. And what came out wasn&rsquo;tquitethe same, but beautiful and weird and extraordinary in its own right. All this to say: I think that rocksteady music is the music of true enjoyment, the aural equivalent of a slice of bacon, and a rocksteady party was the kind of party I imagined Prue&rsquo;s parents would throw to celebrate Mac and Prue&rsquo;s joyful return. And I&rsquo;ll bet that Prue&rsquo;s dad dug deep for some Lewis sides&mdash;maybe he even had them on 45.\"Tam Lin\"by Fairport ConventionColin Meloy:  My 60s Brit Folk obsession is fairly well documented, but I thought I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t include an old folk song in this list. This one, in particular, features a forbidding forest and an evil fairy queen and a pair of star-crossed lovers. Clocking in just north of seven minutes, it&rsquo;s as immersive and complete a narrative as a song can hope to retell.\"Jar of Hearts\"by Christina PerriCarson Ellis: I love Sibylle Baier&rsquo;s mournful songs and I listened to them a lot when I was working onWildwood, especially during the rainy months. Portland winters can be dreary and sometimes gloomy music is the best thing for them. This isn&rsquo;t my very favorite song of hers, but I chose it because, you know, the title.\"I Lost Something in the Hills\"by Sibylle BaierCarson Ellis: The intensity and focused passion of this song makes me think of my darling Jack, along with the references to heaven and hell, a favorite theme of his.\"My Lovely Elizabeth\"by S.E. RogieCarson Ellis: Wildwood has a lot of illustrations&mdash;85 in all&mdash;and it was hard work getting them done. Man, I love to draw but at times this project was exhausting. At times it was downright grueling. Fortunately, I have some remedies for this: taking a walk always helps, as does yoga, as does S. E. Rogie.\"Katie Cruel\"by Karen DaltonCarson Ellis: This is a spooky traditional song that dates back to the Revolutionary War. LikeWildwood&rsquo;s villainess, Alexandra, Katie Cruel roams the forest and the &ldquo;bogs and mire,&rdquo; jilted and in exile. This is a good song to listen to while walking in Forest Park, the real woods that were the inspiration forWildwood&rsquo;s Impassable Wilderness. Or while walking in any misty, quiet forest where beards of moss hang from the gnarled branches of dead trees and there&rsquo;s little sign of civilization. You can imagine that around any bend you might find the solitary hut of Katie Cruel, a little curl of smoke drifting up from its chimney and the sound of her high lonesome banjo coming from within. I also love this song&rsquo;s beautiful, totally unhinged chorus:Oh that I was where I would be,Then I would be where I am not,Here I am where I must beGo where I would, I cannot.\"Over the Hills and Far Away\"by Led ZeppelinCarson Ellis: I&rsquo;m a longtime Led Zeppelin fan and this song, in addition to having a fitting title, was another one I loved when I was Prue&rsquo;s age. I first heard it around the time I read The Hobbit, and I thought its medieval vagabond vibe was awesome. I&rsquo;m also a sucker for a song that starts with a pretty guitar part and then gets crazy. As an adult I tend to like Zeppelin&rsquo;s earlier, bluesier stuff better but, as a kid, I loved the Middle Earth-ish stuff and &ldquo;Over the Hills and Far Away&rdquo; was my jam.A Look InsideWildwoodClick on the images below to open larger versions.

{"asin": "0062024035", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "Divergent", "price": 4.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 42}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91o13sPo7VL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062024043", "006202406X", "014242417X", "0385737955", "0142402516", "0062287338", "014241543X", "0545663261", "0375842209", "0439023521", "0062345214", "0545586178", "014241493X", "0061150142", "0007536747", "1416955070", "0307588378", "0142410705", "014242207X", "0440237688", "0812550706", "0385738765", "0525478817", "014240733X", "014241977X", "0375869026", "159514188X", "0385738781", "078685197X", "0062059947", "0545670314", "0618901868", "1451696191", "1594746036", "0316218502", "0439783607", "0385523394", "014240120X", "0061726834", "0307341577", "0142418471", "0385732554", "0812550757", "141691837X", "0765330342", "0439023513", "0689852231", "1250012570", "0544336259", "0446310786", "1500172820", "1250007208", "0553381687", "037582233X", "0385730586", "0345514408", "B0095H4FAA", "0547904142", "0307341550", "054792822X", "1416971718", "0547328613", "1250006899", "0061726818", "0142421715", "0142420891", "0061146307", "0307947300", "0553593714", "0142427551", "0689829833", "1416990682", "0440239125", "1595144676", "0399501487", "0061950726", "0446547638", "0143118390", "0385373791", "1416912053", "0451524934", "0062301675", "1416972250", "0312367546", "1455545384", "0380807343", "0152061541", "0385742894", "0812974492", "0312384483", "0849946158", "0375850864", "1594746125", "0142425990", "1423113462", "0765362430", "0312642970", "1400079152", "038549565X"], "bought_together": ["014242417X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062024043", "0062278789", "014242417X", "006202406X"]}}

{"asin": "0062024175", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 8 Up-Flinn reinvents the \"Rapunzel\" story as a teen thriller. Rachel spends her days and nights alone in a tower. Her sole contact with humanity is the daily visit of \"Mama,\" and Rachel both loves and rebels against her jailor. Then Wyatt arrives in town. His mother is hoping that he will begin to recover from his friends' deaths in a car accident. He can't understand why no one in this small town seems perturbed by the number of missing teenagers, one of whom was his mother's best friend. He also can't understand why he is apparently the only one who can hear a girl singing somewhere in the frozen woods. When he sets out to find her, he puts into motion a chain of events that leads him, Rachel, and her \"mother\" into a showdown with violent drug manufacturers and their imprisoned labor force. Flinn cleverly weaves fantasy and realism together into what seems to be almost a new genre. Rather than the cop-out of a dystopian future setting, her story is grounded in the reality of an upstate New York where unemployment is rife, it is always winter, and there is no cell-phone service. Teens will identify and sympathize with Wyatt's loss and Rachel trapped in her tower, and they will rejoice in the tenderness of their blooming romance amid the menace of drug violence.

{"asin": "0062024027", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica RothQ:What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?Roth:One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&rsquo;t rely on it, because it&rsquo;s not guaranteed and it&rsquo;s not permanent and it&rsquo;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&mdash;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&mdash;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&rsquo;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&rsquo;t fall apart.Q:You&rsquo;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?Roth:Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&mdash;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,Divergentis me writing through that realization&mdash;everyone in Beatrice&rsquo;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&rsquo;s a little twisted.I think we all secretly love and hate categories&mdash;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&mdash;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.Q:If you could add one more faction to the world withinDivergent, what would it be?Roth:I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &ldquo;seven heavenly virtues:&rdquo; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&rsquo;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.Q:What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&rsquo;ve created inDivergent?Roth:All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&rsquo;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&rsquo;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.Q:What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?Roth:I recently finishedImaginary Girlsby Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &ldquo;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&rdquo; or something to that effect. It&rsquo;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&rsquo;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&mdash;that shows you that people aren&rsquo;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.Imaginary Girlsgave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.", "title": "Divergent (Book 1) (Divergent Series)", "price": 4.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 3628}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Mry4w810L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062024043", "006202406X", "0062345214", "0525478817", "0439023483", "0385737947", "0439023491", "0439023513", "039925675X", "0062059939", "1416914285", "0062059963", "0545265355", "014242417X", "B00GDKJZG6", "1416914307", "0525421033", "0525475060", "1423157516", "0061974552", "1442416890", "1423157370", "0525423648", "1451696205", "1442408626", "B006W3Y9HY", "0316134023", "0142402516", "1416975861", "1416914293", "0375831002", "0062059998", "B00GQQ75QO", "0385738757", "0385738773", "0525478183", "014241543X", "1423140591", "1416975888", "0399256938", "1423146735", "0312641893", "014241493X", "1250012570", "1250030951", "0547995660", "0142410705", "0142422010", "0385738765", "0375843299", "0761463275", "0385737955", "1595141715", "0545663261", "0142425990", "0142420891", "0618126988", "0525426361", "0439064864", "0545586178", "006228648X", "0590353403", "0061974617", "1595143661", "0142419400", "1595143106", "0062286471", "B0084IG7KC", "0385738781", "B008JFUS5A", "1595141758", "1423140605", "1423183649", "0553103547", "030758836X", "0061726834", "0545670314", "0375869026", "0307931897", "1451696191", "0142418471", "0062217135", "0345527763", "0486266907", "141697590X", "0345538374", "0307744434", "0399256776", "080509461X", "B00J4D9X1G", "0062059947", "0062194720", "0062059971", "B00CWBMS2S", "0849946158", "0385373791"], "bought_together": ["0062024043", "006202406X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062024043", "0062278789", "014242417X", "006202406X"]}}

Autumn and her younger brother unfortunately inherited the mental illness, but recovered through the incredible discovery by her father of a cure that has helped them and thousands of others.Some children inherit the family nose. Autumn Stringam and her brother Joseph inherited bipolar disorder, a severe mental illness that led to the suicides of their mother and grandfather. Autumn, at 22, was psychotic and in a psychiatric hospital on suicide watch; Joseph, at 15, was prone to violent episodes so terrifying the family feared for their lives.

When the farm is damaged by a tornado, the women discover a man lying in their field, struck by lightning and suffering from amnesia. The storm&#x2019;s aftermath also brings an unexpected visit from Gretchen&#x2019;s daughter, Abby. As the cleanup begins, the Brink women have much to sort through, including determining the identity of the mysterious stranger. Abby is convinced he is her long-lost father, Sam. Gretchen harbors the same suspicion, although she knows Sam is not really Abby&#x2019;s father, despite telling everyone he was when she became pregnant 40 years ago. As the mystery man&#x2019;s identity is slowly revealed, Gretchen contemplates the eventual discovery of her decades-old lie and its impact on her fragile daughter. Despite a plot that is a bit too neatly tied up, this novel offers an interesting cast of characters, particularly the twins, whose lack of sight gives them insight into everyone and everything.

You could almost hear the sigh of relief in Ottawa as Canada&#8217;s most popular, and most controversial, leader since the Second World War left a role in which he&#8217;d been as frank-speaking, as unpredictable, and as resolutely apolitical as any military leader this country has ever seen.Born and raised in Newfoundland, Hillier joined the military as a young man and quickly climbed the ranks. He played a significant role in domestic challenges, such as the 1998 ice story that paralyzed much of eastern Ontario and Quebec, and he quickly became a player on the international scene, commanding an American corps in Texas and a multinational NATO task force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But it was his role as General Rick Hillier, Canada&#8217;s Chief of the Defence Staff, that defined him as a Canadian public figure. In Afghanistan, Canada faced its first combat losses since the Korean War and every casualty suddenly became front-page news. A country formerly ambivalent or even angry about its role in the conflict suddenly became gripped by the drama playing out not only in the war zone of a country half-way around the world, but in the unfriendly conference rooms in the country&#8217;s capital as Hillier pulled no punches, demanding more funding and more troops and more appreciation for the women and men fighting a war on foreign soil.A Soldier Firstis a hard-hitting, frank account of Hillier&#8217;s role in his own words.

Forced to return home to Blue Hills when her mother, Evie, suffers a massive stroke, Toni finds the old Victorian where she grew up as crammed full of secrets as it is with clutter. Now she must put her mother&rsquo;s house in order&mdash;and uncover long-buried truths about Evie and her aunt, Anna, who vanished fifty years earlier on the eve of her wedding. By shedding light on the past, Toni illuminates her own mistakes and learns the most unexpected things about love, magic, and a little black dress with the power to break hearts&hellip; and mend them.Amazon Exclusive: Charlaine Harris Interviews Susan McBrideSusan McBride andCharlaine Harrismet in 1999 when Susan&rsquo;s very first novel was published by a small press and Charlaine was an established mystery author, writing two separate series (the Aurora Teagarden and Lily Bard Mysteries).  Susan went on to do five Debutante Dropout Mysteries for HarperCollins/Avon while Charlaine tried her hand at a Southern Vampire Mystery featuring telepathic barmaid Sookie Stackhouse. WhenDead Until Darkwas released in 2001, Susan passed out wax vampire teeth at the Mayhem in the Midlands Convention to celebrate her friend&rsquo;s new book, hoping it might just catch on. My, what a different a dozen years makes!  Charlaine&rsquo;s 11th Southern Vampire Novel,Dead Reckoning, was recently released and hit #1 on virtual every bestsellers list while HBO&rsquo;sTrueBloodheats up the small screen. In the meanwhile, Susan has taken a leap of her own and in a mystical direction as well, penning her first novel of magic realism,Little Black Dress, prompting Charlaine to ask a few questions of her old pal.Charlaine Harris:Writers approach a genre switch with trepidation. Were you excited? Anxious?Susan McBride:I was very comfortable writing series mysteries but always had the itch to try something else. I was fortunate to be asked to write several young adult books and thenThe Cougar Club, my first mainstream novel, which gave me the confidence to attemptLittle Black Dress.  And I needed that confidence!  WritingLittle Black Dresswas the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever gone so deep into a story or into the characters, and it took over my life for months and months.  I&rsquo;m both excited and anxious for the book to come out, wondering what my mystery readers will think of it and hoping it attracts readers who&rsquo;ve never read my books as well.CH:What was your fundamental beginning idea forLittle Black Dress? Was it a key scene, an interesting situation, the character of the protagonist?SM:I&rsquo;d love to say the idea came to me in a dream but it was really very simple.  I was thinking of things that are common to all women&mdash;daughters, sisters, mothers, wives&mdash;and I envisioned a little black dress. Maybe because my mother always insisted that every girl should have at least one in her closet since they worked well at most any function:  cocktail party, graduation, fancy dinners, and, of course, funerals. I wondered, though, what if there was a dress that fit several women in one family, all of whom were different sizes.  And what if this dress was made of a very special silk that seemed &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and that, when donned, made its wearer glimpse her future.  Then I saw two very different sisters from the 1960s, one destined toward spinsterhood and one on the eve of her wedding to a rich man she didn&rsquo;t love.  I wondered how putting on a magic black dress that revealed their fates could change both their lives. Would it push them apart or bind them together? Would the dress affect a second generation?  So that&rsquo;s where I started, and the idea blossomed from there.CH:Why did you decide it was the right time to try something different?SM:I&rsquo;d been contemplating what I wanted to do afterThe Cougar Clubas I so enjoyed telling that tale of three women and their great friendship. I thinkThe Cougar Clubis filled with hope and love, and I wanted to spin another story about hope and love and forgiveness but in a completely different way. Dealing with the magical element was definitely something I hadn&rsquo;t tried before, but my agents and my editor were thrilled. In fact, I felt such enthusiasm from them over myLittle Black Dressidea that it was kind of daunting.  I knew I had to stretch my literary muscles further withLittle Black Dressand dig a little deeper than I had before. Maybe because I have a sister&mdash;and we&rsquo;re as much polar opposites as Anna and Evie Evans inLittle Black Dress, I got very emotional while writing the book. But it all seemed to come together perfectly.  I hate to say I think it&rsquo;s fate, but I do!CH:Was the editing process different for this very different book?SM:Hmm, that&rsquo;s an interesting question!  It was a challenge to make sure I unveiled the mystery of the black dress and the sisters&rsquo; fates in a linear fashion while using two points of view: that of Evie, the older sister, and Antonia, her daughter.  Evie&rsquo;s perspective is very personal and historical, and Toni&rsquo;s viewpoint is much more modern. So it was a matter of keeping the tension there while moving the story along, and reaching a place where past meets present (for want of a better description).  My agents and my editor were incredibly insightful, and the novel is much stronger for their input.CH:Do you think you&rsquo;ll want to write more books likeLittle Black Dress, or do you think you&rsquo;ll return to conventional mysteries?SM:Yes, I&rsquo;d love to write more books likeLittle Black Dresswith magical elements.  It&rsquo;s very freeing to know you can go beyond the boundaries of reality and what&rsquo;s considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in these books, and I adore that feeling.  In fact, I&rsquo;ll be dipping into the world of magic realism with my next novel,Little White Lies.CH:Last but not least, do you have a great little black dress that you can&rsquo;t live without?SM:I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say that I don&rsquo;t.  I just have a really old one hanging in the back of my closet. And it would probably take some magic to make it fit.

{"asin": "0062021338", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Prolific Feehan (Dark Melody, etc.) continues her supernatural Dark series with this 13th installment, the first to feature a female Carpathian. Though Carpathians roam the streets at night and gain strength from feeding on blood, they only kill evildoers and vampires. Transformed into a night creature when she was a child, Destiny is unlike any of Feehan's previous heroines. Her physical strength is equal to that of her Carpathian counterpart, Nicolae Von Shrieder, but she's horrified by what she is and haunted by memories of her parents' brutal murder. Nicolae merged his mind with hers when she was first transformed, and through their mental connection, he taught her how to survive. Now Nicolae must find Destiny and make her his lifemate, or he will succumb to darkness and become a vampire. Feehan's protagonists and prose can be overwrought (\"His body was hard and full, aching for her.... and deep within, the crouching beast lifted its head and roared for release\"), and inconsistencies litter the text (Destiny can supposedly read Nicolae's mind, but it takes her eons to trust him and stop threatening to kill him). However, the story has sufficient sensuality to keep readers sated, and fans should appreciate Feehan's unusual pairing of two Carpathians.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062023586", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This debut novel in verse effectively captures the angsty life of 16-year-old Marcie Foster. After her father leaves her mother for a 27-year-old man, Marcie and her depressed mom move from Idaho to a family summer home in New Hampshire. Here Marcie falls for J. D., a boy who is an irresistible cross between Prince Harry (his hair) and David Beckham (his abs). Only problem: Linus, her emo-rocker boyfriend 2,000 miles away. Seven months later, Marcie moves back to Idaho with her father, confesses to Linus, and has to deal with the fallout. Marcie funnels her pain into writing poetry&#x2014; &#x201C;there is no three strikes / when it comes to dating. / One heartbreak and that&#x2019;s it.&#x201D;&#x2014;and her poems, which vary in form, are what compose this verse novel. While the subjects cover typical teenage problems, including breakups, friendships, and parental issues, Tregay adds depth with her ability, in just a few words, to palpably express both the emotions of love and the physical longings that go along with it. This first novel may make teenage readers&#x2019; hearts beat a bit faster.

{"asin": "0062019856", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Once again, Liu has managed a brilliant blend of fantasy, action and romance in her latest Dirk &amp; Steele novel, which follows the members of a paranormal detective agency. When electrokinetically gifted agency detective Blue Perrineau is blackmailed by his father, dying billionaire Felix Perrineau, he's forced to track down Felix's other son, Daniel&mdash;the brother Blue never knew he had. His search for Daniel takes him to a small Las Vegas circus that features Iris McGillis, a slinky shape-shifter with a lion act and a global fan base. After Blue saves Iris from an ecoterrorist sniper, they form an instant attachment, but he runs into trouble when he finds Daniel and, later, a dangerous flesh peddler&mdash;both of whom also have plans for the hypnotically sexy Iris. Liu brings her skewed universe to life with skill and conviction, grounding the comic-book plot with fully realized personalities and the workaday details of circus life. Though a bit drawn out, this entry will undoubtedly please fans of the series and should provide a fresh thrill for anyone in the market for an extraordinary romance.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "006202471X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 4-7-After defeating the Dowager Governess in Wildwood (2011), Prue McKeel is happy to be at home with her family and Curtis is content with his life as a bandit. All that changes when the two find out that they are being hunted by wolf assassins. The revolution they helped start in South Wood is close to collapse and someone has placed a bounty on the heads of Prue and her friends. After the death of the Elder Mystic, Prue learns that she has a powerful destiny and that she must somehow reanimate the mechanical prince before the other side does or it could mean the end of Wildwood. On top of all this, Curtis's sisters, who he left behind to join the bandits, are trapped working in a machine parts factory. The sisters could hold the key to Prue's success, but the two sides are not destined to meet in this book. At times the story is heartbreaking, but the characters are resilient and strong.  The ending is not a happy one, but it holds the promise of hope for the future. Colin Meloy narrates his own story (2012, both Balzer + Bray), eloquently capturing the accents and personalities of his characters. Fans of the first book as well as those who enjoyed Trenton Lee Stewart's \"The Mysterious Benedict Society\" series will be drawn to the vocabulary, moral dilemmas, and clever humor here.-Sarah Flood, Breckinridge County Public Library, Hardinsburg, KY&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

School may be out for the summer, but the friends smell something fishy at the local pond, which means that they have to dust off their biology and chemistry skills. Fish are dying, there is an obvious cover-up, and they feel somehow that the father of their nemesis, Sara Paxton, is behind it. Mr. Paxton is the CEO of Xylodyne Dynamics and president of the country club. With Briana's disguises, Riley's elaborate plans, and a little luck, the young detectives hope to expose what's buried at the golf course. When Riley's dad, stationed in Afghanistan, gets embroiled in the scheme and his mom steps in to help, it is up to Riley to solve the mystery before it is too late.

{"asin": "0062024701", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Product DescriptionPrue McKeel&rsquo;s life is ordinary. At least until her baby brother is abducted by a murder of crows. And then things get really weird.You see, on every map of Portland, Oregon, there is a big splotch of green on the edge of the city labeled &ldquo;I.W.&rdquo; This stands for &ldquo;Impassable Wilderness.&rdquo; No one&rsquo;s ever gone in&mdash;or at least returned to tell of it.And this is where the crows take her brother.So begins an adventure that will take Prue and her friend Curtis deep into the Impassable Wilderness. There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much bigger as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle for the very freedom of this wilderness.A wilderness the locals call Wildwood.Wildwoodis a spellbinding tale full of wonder, danger, and magic that juxtaposes the thrill of a secret world and modern city life. Original and fresh yet steeped in classic fantasy, this is a novel that could have only come from the imagination of Colin Meloy, celebrated for his inventive and fantastic storytelling as the lead singer of the Decemberists. With dozens of intricate and beautiful illustrations by award-winning artist Carson Ellis,Wildwoodis truly a new classic for the twenty-first century.AWildwoodPlaylist by Colin Meloy &amp; Carson Ellis\"Ramble On\"by Led ZeppelinColin Meloy: I remember reading an interview with Evan Dando from the Lemonheads right around the time the first Lord of the Rings movie came out, bemoaning the fact that the director hadn&rsquo;t included asingleZeppelin song in the movie. I tend to agree; I mean, how rad would it&rsquo;ve been after that dramatic ending inThe Return of the King, with all its royal celebrations and slo-mo montages&mdash;the screen goes black and those monster riffs of &ldquo;Immigrant Song&rdquo; kick in? Mind-blowing. So much incredible music in the 60s and 70s was directly fueled by mid-century fantasy fiction, something thatWildwoodowes much to; I feel it would be deeply remiss here not to include a little Zepp.\"Marching Song\"by Esben and the WitchColin Meloy: That said, when I was deep in my preadolescent reverie of fantasy and sci-fi, my friends and I would meet every weekend at someone&rsquo;s house to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. There. Confession made. And as everyone knows, the best Dungeon Masters always partnered up their biggest action scenarios with music. While I think it may have been de rigueur to blast Zeppelin or Hawkwind for some folks, I considered myself to be somewhat of a sophisticate. Joy Division was perfect music for a slow, suspenseful crawl through a gelatinous cube-infested grotto. The Legendary Pink Dots added an extra dimension to a party&rsquo;s first encounter with some weird, reclusive nemesis in a castle tower. An Enchantress might appear to &ldquo;Under Ice&rdquo; by Kate Bush or anything from Siouxsie&rsquo;s output. When I first heard this song from Brighton, England&rsquo;s Esben and the Witch (even the name is evocative of those days) I imagined a new generation of over-imaginative ten-year-olds pairing their fantastical ramblings with the drowning rains and empty plains of this song.\"Take It Easy\"by Hopeton LewisColin Meloy: Switching gears, here. Rocksteady, a kind of precursor to the reggae explosion of the 70s, was a beautiful, thoughtful, random amalgam of classic R&amp;B and traditional Jamaican rhythms. It&rsquo;s clearly the kind of music that is birthed out of necessity; a bunch of poor kids in the slums of Kingston figuring out for themselves how to re-create the sounds that they were hearing over crappy radio speakers: Sam Cooke, Ben E. King, and Sam &amp; Dave. And what came out wasn&rsquo;tquitethe same, but beautiful and weird and extraordinary in its own right. All this to say: I think that rocksteady music is the music of true enjoyment, the aural equivalent of a slice of bacon, and a rocksteady party was the kind of party I imagined Prue&rsquo;s parents would throw to celebrate Mac and Prue&rsquo;s joyful return. And I&rsquo;ll bet that Prue&rsquo;s dad dug deep for some Lewis sides&mdash;maybe he even had them on 45.\"Tam Lin\"by Fairport ConventionColin Meloy:  My 60s Brit Folk obsession is fairly well documented, but I thought I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t include an old folk song in this list. This one, in particular, features a forbidding forest and an evil fairy queen and a pair of star-crossed lovers. Clocking in just north of seven minutes, it&rsquo;s as immersive and complete a narrative as a song can hope to retell.\"Jar of Hearts\"by Christina PerriCarson Ellis: I love Sibylle Baier&rsquo;s mournful songs and I listened to them a lot when I was working onWildwood, especially during the rainy months. Portland winters can be dreary and sometimes gloomy music is the best thing for them. This isn&rsquo;t my very favorite song of hers, but I chose it because, you know, the title.\"I Lost Something in the Hills\"by Sibylle BaierCarson Ellis: The intensity and focused passion of this song makes me think of my darling Jack, along with the references to heaven and hell, a favorite theme of his.\"My Lovely Elizabeth\"by S.E. RogieCarson Ellis: Wildwood has a lot of illustrations&mdash;85 in all&mdash;and it was hard work getting them done. Man, I love to draw but at times this project was exhausting. At times it was downright grueling. Fortunately, I have some remedies for this: taking a walk always helps, as does yoga, as does S. E. Rogie.\"Katie Cruel\"by Karen DaltonCarson Ellis: This is a spooky traditional song that dates back to the Revolutionary War. LikeWildwood&rsquo;s villainess, Alexandra, Katie Cruel roams the forest and the &ldquo;bogs and mire,&rdquo; jilted and in exile. This is a good song to listen to while walking in Forest Park, the real woods that were the inspiration forWildwood&rsquo;s Impassable Wilderness. Or while walking in any misty, quiet forest where beards of moss hang from the gnarled branches of dead trees and there&rsquo;s little sign of civilization. You can imagine that around any bend you might find the solitary hut of Katie Cruel, a little curl of smoke drifting up from its chimney and the sound of her high lonesome banjo coming from within. I also love this song&rsquo;s beautiful, totally unhinged chorus:Oh that I was where I would be,Then I would be where I am not,Here I am where I must beGo where I would, I cannot.\"Over the Hills and Far Away\"by Led ZeppelinCarson Ellis: I&rsquo;m a longtime Led Zeppelin fan and this song, in addition to having a fitting title, was another one I loved when I was Prue&rsquo;s age. I first heard it around the time I read The Hobbit, and I thought its medieval vagabond vibe was awesome. I&rsquo;m also a sucker for a song that starts with a pretty guitar part and then gets crazy. As an adult I tend to like Zeppelin&rsquo;s earlier, bluesier stuff better but, as a kid, I loved the Middle Earth-ish stuff and &ldquo;Over the Hills and Far Away&rdquo; was my jam.A Look InsideWildwoodClick on the images below to open larger versions.

Filled to the brim with courtly intrigue, dangerous misapprehensions, crossings and double-crossings, and enough high humor to ensure at least some giggling through many portions, the story begins by ably portraying Godiva as fiercely loyal to her beloved husband, Leofric, Earl of Mercia, while also quite capable of using her feminine wiles to ensure his people also remain loyal to him. Galland&#x2019;s reinterpretation of history rests on the harsh, impoverishing tax known as the heregeld, introduced to England in 1040 by its improbably Danish king, Harthacnut. After his death, his half brother, Edward, ascended the throne yet, unfortunately, did not rescind the wildly unpopular heregeld. Lady Godiva&#x2019;s genuine yet often blithe attempts to spare her people a dreadful fate spurred by the heregeld make up the bulk of the story line, while a romantic subplot involving unlikely players adds interest. Entertaining and funny, this easily classifies as a historical-fiction beach read, unlikely as that may sound, although purists may quibble with Galland&#x2019;s historical liberties. --Julie Trevelyan", "title": "Godiva: A Novel", "price": 6.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 103585}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-RiUCLNjL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["045141778X", "0425258025", "0425259463", "0060787236", "B0045EPDCC", "0425268764", "0062026879", "B005IUVLBE", "1402274629", "1451648626", "0778314316", "0399159223", "0451417798", "1451626096", "B00F6EZS4S", "1402274599", "1445614863", "1451626118", "0312675461", "0007446993", "B00A19UHZS", "0007446977", "1439183163", "0758271387", "1402271085", "042525836X", "1491280093", "1400069297", "1482785390", "0752488120", "0345534093", "0345511913", "1909520470", "0553808141", "0425242021", "0312658494", "0451236807", "0374280878", "0345534115", "1452063060", "B0058M7Z1C", "0451418875", "0062123467", "0307953041", "1442476877", "1445633914", "0990324508", "0307589293", "0345523970", "147670306X", "0987417649", "0758265999", "1451661517", "147780529X", "0345523903", "0451417801", "1476712808", "140227663X", "1402225180", "075153899X", "1250044103", "1782640088", "1402265948", "1451633246", "0684869241", "0758273223", "0451236904", "B006Z314RE", "0751541362", "0765331233", "1402294069", "0345523962", "0425243044", "1610393635", "1402237669", "0547740107", "B00E1LT41K", "1476703558", "1848452985", "1451626088", "1476703078", "B007SRYV0I", "1402229992", "141655047X", "0345521366", "0345534131", "0345517563", "1476703094", "B00BDI6GX8", "0553808133", "0425238970", "140224522X", "0812968972", "1250000122", "0751529575", "0752465848", "0544222881", "0804108447", "1416563717", "B005MWK3MQ"], "bought_together": ["045141778X", "0425258025"], "buy_after_viewing": ["045141778X", "0451417798", "0778314316", "1451633246"]}}
{"asin": "0062020560", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* It begins with a preadolescent kiss between protagonist Cameron and her friend, Irene. The very next day Cameron&#x2019;s parents die in an automobile accident, and the young girl is left riddled with guilt, feeling her forbidden kiss was somehow responsible for the accident. This is an old convention of GLBT literature, but freshly handled here and given sophisticated thematic weight. As Cameron grows into her teenage years, she recognizes that she is a lesbian. After several emotional misadventures, she meets and falls in love with the beautiful Coley, who appears to be bisexual. Both girls attend the same fundamentalist church, and when Cameron&#x2019;s conservative Aunt Ruth discovers the affair, she remands Cameron to God&#x2019;s Promise, a church camp that promises to &#x201C;cure&#x201D; young people of their homosexuality. Such &#x201C;religious conversion therapy&#x201D; is rooted in reality, and Cam&#x2019;s experiences at the camp are at the heart of this ambitious literary novel, a multidimensional coming-of-age reminiscent of Aidan Chambers&#x2019; equally ambitious This Is All (2006). There is nothing superficial or simplistic here, and Danforth carefully and deliberately fleshes out Cam&#x2019;s character and those of her family and friends. Even the eastern Montana setting is vividly realized and provides a wonderfully apposite background for the story of Cam&#x2019;s miseducation and the challenges her stint in the church camp pose to her development as a mature teenager finding friendship and a plausible future.

{"asin": "0062028030", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "This sequel to Stuck in Neutral (2001) is short but packs a punch. Readers will certainly remember Shawn McDaniel, who is profoundly disabled. He is unable to speak or control his bodily functions, and he can&#x2019;t make anyone understand that despite appearances, he is something of a genius, aware of everything that goes on around him. Written in the same smart voice, the book allows readers to see life through Shawn&#x2019;s eyes, not only the frustrations but also the gratitude for what life has to offer him; for example, a mother who loves him and, yes, clean socks. Then the unexpected happens: a relative with Down syndrome, functioning at the level of a five-year-old, is taken in (along with her dog, Rusty) by Shawn&#x2019;s mother, and for the first time, Shawn feels like there are two souls who understand him. Shawn&#x2019;s grand mal seizures allow the book to take a mystical turn, which provides a satisfactory way of completing Shawn&#x2019;s story, especially for those who&#x2019;ve long waited to learn what happened next.

{"asin": "006202681X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 8-11-Amelia, a Risen ghost, is back in Oklahoma with her boyfriend, Joshua, trying to come to terms with her afterlife. She has the ability to be seen by non-Seers, touch objects, smell the intoxicating scents around her, and even eat, but she can no longer touch Joshua. Kiss Joshua. Hold Joshua. Even as she begins to realize that this half-life can't go on for him, the Netherworld demons make yet another play for Amelia's soul. This time they threaten to kill one of her loved ones each week until she surrenders to them. Amelia must come up with a plan that will end this battle once and for all-or sacrifice her soul to save those she loves the most. Though the first chapters seem slow, this final volume in the trilogy gathers steam as it progresses and will have readers glued to its pages for the final battle on High Bridge. Once again Amelia's characteristic inclinations to keep secrets and protect everyone continue to provide unexpected plot twists and suspense. The romance between Amelia and Joshua continues to maintain tension, possibly more so with the new constraints imposed by her Risen status. Fans of the first two titles won't be disappointed in this story, though they will have much to say about the way it ends, at least for Amelia and Joshua.-Heather E.

Her best friend, Lucy, is going to camp and then moving away forever and Ashley's mom has roped her into babysitting for a friend's daughter for three weeks before she can meet Lucy at camp. While she is wallowing in her sadness, Ashley stumbles upon a magic jar full of wishes among her mom's junk. Soon after seven-year-old Claire arrives&#x2014;full of enthusiasm, energy, and surprises. She has a long list of things that she wants to do while she is visiting. But all Ashley can think about is her wish jar, reading her new P. J. Walker novel, and getting through the next three weeks so that she can finally spend time with Lucy. Ashley decides that Claire is \"like the golden retriever of people&#x2014;everyone loves her.\" And, although her enthusiasm is exhausting, Claire turns out to be exactly what Ash needs to get through all the upheaval of the summer. Harper connects people and events seamlessly throughout the story, keeping readers engaged to the end. It will be easy for kids to empathize with Claire as she comes to terms with the loss of her mom, and with Ashley, as she grapples with all of the changes in her life.

{"asin": "0062025473", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Scott Bolzan went to work on December 17, 2008, like any other Wednesday. By that afternoon, he'd lost every memory of his past.Awakening in a hospital with no memory of who he was or how he got there, the forty-six-year-old didn&#8217;t know that the petite blonde at his side was his wife of twenty-four years, Joan&#8212;or even what a wife was. He couldn&#8217;t remember the births of his two young-adult children, the daughter he&#8217;d lost, his time as an offensive lineman for the NFL&#8217;s Cleveland Browns, or his flourishing aviation career.Scott&#8217;s life and the lives of everyone who loved him were forever changed when he slipped, hit his head, and lost consciousness in his office bathroom, suffering one of the most severe cases of permanent retrograde amnesia on record. With heartrending honesty and no shortage of humor, the Bolzans share their remarkable journey as Scott navigates his way through a now-unfamiliar world. The challenges are initially overwhelming: Scott&#8217;s debilitating headaches, his relearning of social etiquette (taking cues fromThe Sopranos!), Joan&#8217;s grief over the loss of the man she married and their shared history, the financial burden of Scott&#8217;s lost income, his mounting medical bills, and the agony of their twenty-year-old son&#8217;s struggles with drug addiction.But remarkably,My Life, Deletedis above all else a celebration of extraordinary perseverance, and of the enduring love that emerges when we are most tested. Scott learns to trust his intuition in a way few people ever will, while Joan taps into a well of patience and resourcefulness she didn&#8217;t know she had. Throughout it all, what unfolds&#8212;against all odds&#8212;is an enviable romance as Scott and Joan fall in love all over again.Both gut-wrenching and brimming with optimism, the Bolzans&#8217; captivating story makes a powerful statement about commitment&#8212;and the possibility of finding extraordinary opportunity in life&#8217;s greatest challenges.", "title": "My Life, Deleted", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 836068}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411yWFOva2L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0786022175", "0786022183", "0786035110", "1451695195", "0470442514", "0786022191", "143916827X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0470442514", "0786032553", "0786035110", "0385606265"]}}

{"asin": "0062030310", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Madeleine Albright on WritingPrague WinterOn the evening of February 4, 1997, I led the cabinet into the House of Representatives prior to the President&rsquo;s annual address&mdash;the first woman ever to do so.  Exchanging greetings with senators and other dignitaries, my heart should have been joyful; instead, I was stunned.  That morning&rsquo;sWashington Postheadline had read: &ldquo;Albright Family Tragedy Comes to Light.&rdquo;I was 59 when I learned from a reporter and from certain letters I had received that my ancestral heritage was Jewish and that more than two dozen of my relatives had died in the Holocaust.  The revelation shook my deeply ingrained sense of identity, and prompted me to seek answers to questions that I had never before thought to ask.  That search began with visits to the small towns in Czechoslovakia where my parents had grown up and to the ancient synagogue where the names of Holocaust victims are enshrined.Prague Winteris a continuation of that personal journey, but also a much wider tale concerning a generation compelled to make painful moral choices amid the tumult of war.In 1939, when efforts by British and French leaders to appease Hitler had backfired, the Nazis invaded my homeland.  I was not yet two years old.  My parents escaped with me to London where my father became head of broadcasting for the Czechoslovak government in exile.  Strangers in an embattled land, we endured along with our new neighbors the terrible bombing of the Blitz.  Back home, the German occupation quickly evolved into a reign of terror under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, &ldquo;The Butcher of Prague.&rdquo;  As preparations were made to exterminate the country&rsquo;s Jews, Czechoslovak parachutists returned to their native soil with a mission: to kill Heydrich -- the only successful assassination of a senior Nazi during the war.  In the months that followed that daring assault, Czechs suffered from Hitler&rsquo;s vengeance, while Jews confined to the infamous Terezin ghetto struggled to retain hope despite overcrowded conditions and the periodic departure of fellow inmates on trains to the east.  In England, Czechoslovak leaders maneuvered to reclaim their country&rsquo;s independence; my mother and father agonized over the fate of loved ones who had remained behind.From the day America entered the war, my parents and their friends were confident the Allies would win. As democrats from Central Europe, they prayed that the United States&mdash;not the Soviet Union&mdash;would wield the decisive postwar influence in our region. It was not to be. When at last the Nazis were defeated, Czechoslovakia became again a battleground between democracy and totalitarianism; before long, my family was forced into exile for the second time, finding a permanent home in America.The story ofPrague Winteris often as intensely personal as a mother&rsquo;s letter, a father&rsquo;s hidden sorrow, and the earnest artwork of an imprisoned ten-year-old cousin.  The themes, however, are universal: loyalty and betrayal, respect and bigotry, accommodating evil or fighting back.  What fascinates me is why we make the choices we do. What prompts one person to act boldly in a moment of crisis and a second to seek shelter in the crowd? Why do some people become stronger in the face of adversity while others quickly lose heart?

Having escaped from the prison-like Maxfield Academy with the injured Becky, Benson comes across a town in the wilderness populated by the human versions of the teenage robots back at the school. What&#x2019;s more, these teens have a semi-psychic connection with their android counterparts, through which they can see, hear, and feel. One thing they can&#x2019;t do, however, is run because of the chips implanted in their brains. So Benson plots for a way to get them out from under the nefarious (and still quite mysterious) hand of Maxfield. In many ways, this is a remake of Variant, with Benson trying to outwit the overlords and head for freedom. However, the claustrophobic tightness of the first book is replaced here by a loose series of threats that never solidify into something worth rooting against. Newcomers will be thoroughly lost, but those who rightfully loved Variant will still hold on to hope&#x2014;because the final scene has one doozy of a revelation.

{"asin": "0062025724", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 6-10-Sixteen-year-old Ellie is used to being an outsider: she's blond, statuesque, and Graham Overholt's little sister-no guys dare get too friendly with her as long as the golden boy, high school sports star is watching. Normally her visits to her grandmother in Norway are different. She blends in with the locals and everyone is typically friendly. But not this summer. Instead, she is greeted with suspicion and even hostility. Young men have been disappearing at an alarming rate, and a ridiculous-sounding rumor has begun that these vanishings are the work of Valkyries: beautiful women from mythology who were seen around battlefields gathering the souls of young men for Odin's army of the undead in Valhalla. Ellie would think the rumor was ridiculous, too, except she's seen the strong, beautiful women who've appeared in the clubs just before some men have gone missing, and suddenly her grandmother is acting strange as well. To complicate matters, Graham's infuriating and irresistibly handsome best friend has also come to Norway. What Ellie doesn't know is that Tuck has a secret, and it might save or doom the young men of the village. With guest appearances from Odin, Loki, and even the Morrigan, the plot in this creatively imagined but incompletely executed book creeps along for the first half, then struggles to gain its footing as Ellie accepts who she is and what she is up against. If readers ignore the flat characters and stick with the book to the end, they will be rewarded with a thrilling climax where the mythological characters intersect and become better realized.-Heather M.

The Hansens&mdash;Elliot, Helen and college-age daughter Abby&mdash;spend a week at a swanky New Hampshire hotel shortly after Helen's oncologist gives her nine months to live. Old family friends come out for the decadent soiree, and as the parents reminisce with friends, Abby wanders the woodsy grounds in a self-absorbed funk, hiding from the humiliation brought about by her mother's diminished capacity. Then one of the hotel's waiters, Alex, begins courting her with poetry and secret notes, and Abby is both attracted and repelled by Alex and the gang of summer employees, who have a predilection for skinny dipping and pot brownies. As Abby slides bumpily from shrugging off reality to facing her mother's fate, the assembled friends and family prepare for a round of wrenching farewells. Chenoweth's smart, unsentimental and poignant takes on living and dying ring true, and her exploration of coming-of-age and coming to terms with mortality is divine.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062034626", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In her second novel (after The Sweet Edge), Pick tackles the Holocaust with the story of a young Jewish family struggling to survive as the Nazis invade Czechoslovakia. Throughout 1938 and 1939, Pavel and Anneliese Bauer endure increasingly terrifying attacks on their dignity, freedom, and lives, clinging to a hope that the madness will soon end. Meanwhile, a present-day Holocaust historian (who remains awkwardly unidentified for some time), specializing in the Kindertransport and the many children it helped to escape from Czechoslovakia, takes a personal interest in the Bauers. Letters culled from the historian's files, written by people who were close to the Bauers, effectively punctuate the novel, but Pick's shuffling gamble with point-of-view produces mixed results. For instance, Marta, who both propels the tale and plays a significant role in it, is sometimes so na&iuml;ve as to be unconvincing. But period details are authentic and well presented, as are the family's suffering and grief. (Apr.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Feeling culpable in her father's death, Gray leaves New York and takes a job at Camp Carolina for the summer, hoping to lose the pounds she gained bingeing in her guilt and grief, and to also meet Eden, the girl she believes to be her stepsister, discovered via a mysterious bequest while executing her father's will. But Eden, a born loner who Gray assumes resulted from an extramarital fling, rejects Gray's efforts to open up. Gray's summer job does prove life altering, and not just physically: she distrusts the camp owner, begins to draw herself into the knotty social lives of her charges, and flirts with the athletic director. Affectingly narrated by Gray in a tone that often echoes pro-anorexia message boards, Spechler's latest succeeds in lovingly detailing the agony of self-loathing before it swings wildly into YA territory to teach Gray a lesson about life.

The first surprise inAllegiantis that Roth has switched to using alternating narratives of Tris and Four.  At last readers get to see Tris as Four sees her and if, like me, you&#x2019;ve been dying to get inside his head, you finally get your chance.  One of the best things about this trilogy is the messy, passionate, and wholly authentic love story between these two. For Tris and Four, there is no love triangle, there are no sides to take--as in life, it&#x2019;s only a matter of how their relationship will play out.Allegiantanswers a lot of questions and also delivers some jaw-dropping twists--readers will go outside the fence, learn the origin story of the factions, and, of course, see how it all ends in a finale that packs a wallop and confirms Roth as a writer to watch for a long time to come. --Seira Wilson", "title": "Allegiant (Divergent Series)", "price": 6.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 84}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4TVE-R2L.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062024043", "0062345214", "0062024035", "0062024027", "014242417X", "0142402516", "0385373791", "014241543X", "0545663261", "014241493X", "0385738781", "0385737955", "0007536747", "0385742894", "1416955070", "0142410705", "0375842209", "1442416890", "0385350864", "0062234927", "0525423648", "1416972250", "0385738765", "0545586178", "0525475060", "0439023513", "159514174X", "0142420891", "0525478817", "1442416874", "1416914293", "B00GQQ75QO", "1416972242", "0439023521", "0062059998", "0062059947", "1442416866", "0142418471", "0545670314", "1442403551", "0142425990", "1250007208", "159514188X", "1451696191", "0525426361", "0142427551", "1423146735", "1442444150", "0440237688", "0307588378", "0062059971", "0399256776", "0385732554", "0316322113", "0061726834", "1250007216", "B00FY2QHU6", "034554305X", "1594746125", "014242207X", "B000FXVV4Q", "014241977X", "1455582875", "0061726818", "0763662623", "1423146727", "0142421715", "1250012570", "0544336259", "1442435003", "1423142004", "0385737947", "0312594437", "039916667X", "1602862567", "0312642970", "0545654572", "0553582011", "0307931897", "0670025593", "0812550706", "0756404746", "141697590X", "0345535529", "1455520640", "0399501487", "1442487674", "B00DPCTSS0", "1250049377", "054792822X", "1594632383", "0989768457", "0849946158", "0345542924", "B00GQQ77IU"], "bought_together": ["0062024043", "0062345214"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062024043", "0062278789", "0062024035", "0062345214"]}}

{"asin": "0062026127", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Superpower-laden high-school students tangle with terrorists in Wells&#x2019; YA sci-fi dystopian novel as it marches along a somewhat shaky route, with a boilerplate plot that borrows from Heroes and X-Men. Teenager Aubrey has managed to survive an alcoholic father and poverty, but that all changes when she discovers the power to literally vanish. Her classmate Jack has had to take a menial job that estranges him from his friends. When a militia force rolls into prom and rounds up the bewildered kids, it turns out they are seeking Lambdas, or teenagers infected with a virus that somehow causes them to develop superpowers. Aubrey and Jack get sent to a detention camp and eventually meet determined terrorists Alec and Laura. For the teens, discovering the bigger picture means leaving behind childhood and deciding which side is the right one to be on. While the characters are oddly flat and lack emotional connection, the small-town Utah setting frames this as an every-person story. The promise of a series and a huge cliff-hanger ending should entice some readers to follow the characters and events.

Well, one way would be to meet a real spy. But then, of course, they might be a bit hard to spot (that's in the job description, after all). Or better, read an excellent new novel by a former spy, one who has the gifts of a born storyteller.Spycatcheris such a novel. And Matthew Dunn is that very talented new author. I know of no other spy thriller that so successfully blends the fascinating nuances of the business of espionage and intelligence work with full-throttle suspense storytelling.&rdquo; --Jeffery DeaverAmazon Exclusive: Jeffrey Deaver Interviews Matthew DunnJeffrey Deaver:Matthew, why did you choose to write under your own name and not a pseudonym? Isn&rsquo;t that what most people who&rsquo;ve written about espionage work have done? Are there risks to using your own name?Matthew Dunn:When I was a spy I always operated under completely different identities. At the beginning of every mission, I felt like an actor taking to the stage on the first night. Though an actor can take off his or her costume at the end of the night, often I could not do so for months and in some cases years. I decided to write under my own name for three reasons: First, I wanted to do something that had my real name attached to my work. Second, I felt my readers deserved to know who I really am. And third, I felt it would be cowardly to hide behind another name since I am no longer a spy. Yes, there are severe and immediate risks, and I&rsquo;m conscious of them every day. But I&rsquo;ve chosen those risks. If a team comes for me, I&rsquo;ll deal with it.JD:What kind of man or woman makes an ideal field officer&mdash;one who runs agents?MD:There are many quantifiable traits &ndash; intellect, skills in lateral thinking, a gregarious personality (deployed in exact moments), an unwavering belief that anything is possible, the ability to manipulate, ruthlessness, compassion, leadership, the ability to make rifle-shot decisions, and tremendous courage. But ultimately MI6, the CIA, the French DGSE, the Russian SVR (the successor to the KGB) and Mossad &ndash; that is, the truly &ldquo;global&rdquo; intelligence services &ndash; recruit a particular breed of animal to work as an agent, and one knows that animal when one sees her or him.  That person is simply different from everyone else. If you are a good field officer, your agent (i.e. the foreign national you&rsquo;ve recruited to spy on his country) will trust you with his life. He won&rsquo;t risk execution by working for just MI6 or whatever institution you represent &ndash; he&rsquo;ll do it for you.JD:How autonomous does a field officer have to be? And is operating solo an advantage in the world of intelligence and espionage?MD:Intelligence officers are lone wolves. It&rsquo;s vital that they don&rsquo;t make themselves visible.  One can&rsquo;t get the best intelligence by using a sledgehammer approach. To that extent, there are no &ldquo;superior forces or big guns&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re in the field. Your country&rsquo;s army, navy, and air force are the inferior forces that are liable to get it wrong. And that means you can&rsquo;t trust or use them. But if you mess up and get caught, you will die.JD:Can you describe the operation for which you were awarded an unusual, special commendation by the British government?MD:I can, but I won&rsquo;t.JD:Good call. If you had answered, maybeI'dhave found one of those red laser dots on my forehead&hellip; If there's one vital lesson to be learned in foreign intelligence training, what is it?MD:Mind-set is key. An MI6 officer believes that he or she can achieve anything and very often that self-belief is justified. MI6 is far and away the best intelligence organization at encouraging that outlook. As a result, and based on what it has achieved, it is without doubt the best intelligence organization in the world.JD:What do you mean when you say, &ldquo;When a gun comes out on a deep-cover mission, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen?&rdquo; Talk a bit about the physical aspects of espionage.MD:Officers are typically trained to use guns in tight, urban situations, to deploy highly aggressive and effective unarmed military combat techniques, and to do whatever is necessary to get out of a situation. But the primary role of a spy is to collect intelligence. When guns are deployed &ndash; certain direct actions excluded &ndash; something has gone wrong. Even when things have gone wrong, many good spies would prefer to die and maintain the integrity of the operation than to pull a weapon. No good intelligence comes out of a fight or torture; these actions only result in the pleadings of a man who wants to live. Morality aside, the CIA&rsquo;s use of water boarding made men say anything to keep from drowning. Saying anything, or even providing &ldquo;good information,&rdquo; is a million miles away from providing intelligence, (i.e. something that is most certainly not public knowledge). For that reason and to their peril, the British learned that torture was ineffective in the Boer War. Guns and torture are anathema to intelligence-gathering activities, but they are also bedfellows.JD:Is it hard for retiring foreign-service officers to adapt to private life?MD:Most people who leave are achievers. They get jobs in the top ranks of industry, commerce, government, or maybe some place similar in the arts. But all of us struggle. We are trained to believe that we are better than everyone else when the reality is that we are not. We&rsquo;ve simply seen different, odd things and had to do a job that requires inordinate self-belief. It&rsquo;s taken me ten years to adjust to not being a spy. I&rsquo;m still adjusting.JD:What about the service do you miss?MD:I miss the friendships I had with my foreign agents. They would do the most unbelievably brave things for me, but would always be aware of the danger they were in and their own mortality. I respected them and loved them more than MI6 or anyone else, and that is how it is supposed to be. My agents were my family. We laughed together in one-on-one meetings in swanky hotels and war-zone ditches. We cried together. I held their hands and told them to be brave. I watched the fear and defiance in their eyes as they went back to their tasks. But I was never Matthew Dunn. I was someone else even if the emotion was real. I miss my agents, but they don&rsquo;t miss me because they never knew who I was.

Her friend Edgar helps her break out of prison, but while escaping the Skilled (those with the power to see into the veil separating the living from the dead), they are picked up by the Blackwatch, a powerful militarylike enforcement agency. The Blackwatch is also hunting the evil Silas Dane, whose link to Kate may save or doom them both. Orchestrating both hunts is mysterious and powerful Dalliah, who wants to see more of Kate's rare ability to enter the \"shadowed realm between the living and the dead\" and use that power to speed the veil's destruction. Underdeveloped characters and labored prose bog down what could be a fast-paced adventure. Events of the first book are referenced but not explained, leaving confusing gaps for readers new to the series. Some teens may connect with the story, but if it's Kate's magical talents that interest them, suggest Garth Nix's Sabriel (HarperTeen, 1996) instead.-Brandy Danner, Wilmington Memorial Library, MA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Nothing big, you understand, just enough to convince her pompous British suitor that she's not an eligible candidate for marriage.  She's thinking along the lines of, oh, maybe a discreet tattoo.  But when suspended Texas golf pro Kenny Traveler meets her plane at Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport, Emma decides that he's the perfect candidate to destroy her reputation.Kenny, on the other hand--who desperately wants to be reinstated on the golf tour--is just as determined to keep a low profile and remain squeaky-clean. If Lady Emma weren't a close personal friend of the golf commissioner's wife, he'd never have agreed to squire her around town. Unfortunately for Kenny, his weakness for the British beauty is growing daily, and it seems as though Emma may have feelings for him as well. In a bizarre turn of events, wild man Kenny finds himself trying to keep the prim and proper British lady from causing a scandal the size of which even the lone-star state has never seen, and the results will leave you laughing with delight.Below the hilarious dialogue that is Susan Elizabeth Phillips's trademark, Kenny, Emma, and the charming array of characters that populate this exceptional contemporary are warm and wonderfully human.

But who or what controls what we watch and how we watch it?In Theatre of the Mind, Jay Ingram, whose past scientific investigations include the properties of honey on toast and the complexities of the barmaid&#8217;s brain, tackles one of the most controversial of subjects: consciousness. Scientists have long tried to map our brains and understand how it is that we think and are self-aware, but what do we really know? Any discussion of the brain raises more questions than answers, and Ingram illuminates some of the most perplexing ones: What happens in our minds when we&#8217;re driving and we suddenly realize that we don&#8217;t remember the last few miles of highway? How do we remember images, sounds, and aromas from our past so vividly, and why do we often recreate them so differently in our dreams?

{"asin": "0062047566", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The story starts at the Ristorante Italia, where Tyler indulges in his favorite entr&#xE9;e, spaghetti and meatballs. Chef Lorenzo invites Tyler to the kitchen the next day, and he and dog Tofu start by making pasta. Then it&#x2019;s off to the country for juicy tomatoes, fresh basil, and stinky onions and garlic. Giant cheese wheels encourage Tofu to take a spin on them. Once home, Tyler and his dad start making the tomato sauce, the meatballs, and, finally, the spaghetti. Yum! Except for ingredients, this is not too different from Tyler Makes Pancakes (2012), but the art here may be even better. Using a bright navy blue as an outline (and with plenty of red, white, and blue accents), Frazier&#x2019;s visuals complement and extend the story. He adds humor as well, particularly in the form of Tofu, who is meatball crazy and will run with a spaghetti strand or juggle tomatoes (funniest is when he and Tyler make mustaches out of basil). The recipe and a fact sheet conclude. Even if the intended audience doesn&#x2019;t want to cook themselves, they&#x2019;ll be delighted by the story.

{"asin": "0062048317", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Cultural historian Yalom traces the French view of love through the literature and history of the country via the lives of significant figures, both real and imagined, especially writers and their characters. Beginning with courtly love and the quintessential lovers, Abelard and H&#xE9;lo&#xEF;se, she demonstrates how the French concept of love developed and changed over the years while never losing the unique elements that make romance in France different from anywhere else in the world. Racine&#x2019;s character, Phaedre, the love letters of Julie de Lespinasse, the person and writings of George Sand, and, of course, Cyrano de Bergerac embody the nuances of romantic gallantry, passion during the revolution, love between men, existentialism and amorousness, and twentieth-century ardor. Don&#x2019;t doubt that this is a serious, scholarly work, even as Yalom lightens the tone by inserting asides that illuminate her own wry view of the world.

When the baker who is helping Tyler reminds him that cake for humans is too rich for canines, Tyler is discouraged, but the man comes up with a wonderful substitute: a special cake just for Tofu. The book ends with recipes for two cakes: a carrot cake for humans and a cake with appropriate ingredients for dogs that is shaped like a bone for Tofu. As in the previous two books, Tyler learns where the ingredients come from, as text and illustrations imagine him going with the baker to gather everything and then describe the steps needed to mix all of them together to produce the cake. The large pictures are done with pen and ink, and the digitally colored characters, outlined in blue, are easy to see, making this a book that could be used in storytime along with an actual cake-making project or at home with an adult. Combining a story and a cooking lesson is a novel approach, and it works well for this author and Food Network chef.&#x2014;Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA", "title": "Tyler Makes a Birthday Cake!

Previously he has asserted that a Chinese admiral &#x201C;discovered&#x201D; America and sparked the Renaissance by visiting Italy. In the process, of course, he has infuriated professional historians. Here Menzies turns his attention to the ancient Mediterannean and the Minoan civilization that flourished on the island of Crete in the second millennium B.C. Again using the flimsiest of evidence, he asserts that this Bronze Age, highly localized culture was linked to the mythical &#x201C;lost continent&#x201D; of Atlantis, which was at the center of an immense global trading empire extending north to Britain and west to North America. Still, this will be a fun book for some. It includes brave, adventurous mariners and a dramatic natural disaster (probably the most accurate of Menzies&#x2019; claims).

{"asin": "0062024671", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Holly, the frazzled heroine of YA novelist Sones's latest (What My Girlfriend Doesn't Know), is a writer grappling with menopause, a daughter about to go to college, a husband who drives her crazy, and a crippling case of writer's block. Her mother is ill and in the care of an ineffectual doctor who puts her on steroids that make her violent and forgetful. In the midst of the everyday chaos, Holly has to figure out how to redefine herself as life keeps on changing on her. Sones mixes things up by writing the entire story in verse, with different anecdotes related in different types of poems (as with the concrete poem \"A Brief History of My Boobs\"), but that's where the story's uniqueness ends, as the whimsy of its telling splashes around in the shallow depths of the story itself. Still it's occasionally funny, and its unlikely form may be enough to entice genre enthusiasts looking for something a smidge different. (Apr.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

{"asin": "0062049143", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Justified or not, the Vatican has recently been subjected to numerous attacks for its relationship with the Nazis and its role in the Holocaust. The criticism centers on the activities (or inactivity) of Pope Pius XII. But his predecessor, Pius XI, was cut from different cloth. Before and after his ascension to the Papacy, Pius XI had been an ardent spokesman for &#x201C;social justice&#x201D; and opposition to various forms of racism. As pope, he well understood the dangers posed by fascism and the Nazis and didn&#x2019;t hesitate to criticize Western democracies for their passivity. Before his untimely death, in 1939, Pius was influenced strongly by an American prelate, John La Farge, who had campaigned against racial injustice in the U.S. Eisner, a historian and journalist, suggests that the survival of Pius XI beyond 1939 could have put a much different focus on Catholic-Jewish relations and perhaps ameliorated some aspects of the Holocaust. That is certainly debatable, but this is an interesting work that usefully poses a what-if question while attempting to provide a more balanced view of Vatican policies in the 1930s. --Jay Freeman", "title": "The Pope's Last Crusade: How an American Jesuit Helped Pope Pius XI's Campaign to Stop Hitler", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 400831}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518-Y6aSGOL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312604211", "0812993462", "0674066979", "0670026719", "006202423X", "0770435068", "1586178520", "0674047494", "0674049616", "0895260344", "1601374585", "0814680585", "0199379807", "0393082415", "1586177575", "1594205396", "B00BYCOIWE", "0700612149", "0813220165", "1612787134", "0670024872", "1400069742", "0809105039", "0062105094", "0062333771", "0316220221", "1586179063", "0062089439", "1612786987", "1586177478", "1618901362", "0393058247", "0375706054", "030019160X", "0253008530", "1250000165", "0465027687", "1586176641", "0824519973", "0375760008", "0385495579", "0679729453", "0805062904", "0547863381", "0156006316", "0300121342", "0802866298"], "bought_together": ["0312604211", "0895260344"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0312604211", "0670886939", "0895260344"]}}

{"asin": "0062049763", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Steampunk is a fascinating genre, and Ballantine and Morris have captured it perfectly. I think this series could serve as a great introduction to the genre, in fact, since you really don't have to have much of an understanding of steampunk to enjoy the book. There also seems to be an element or two of the pulp genre, though much of that is actually turned on it's head.-Pew ReviewsIf James Bond wore a corset and drank Earl Grey it might be something like the adventures in Phoenix Rising...The two agents make light-hearted banter whilst chasing down evil villains and mad scientists and getting in and out of scrapes in immaculate period style. It's anachronistic and absurd, but Phoenix Rising has a sweet ending and getting to it is gleeful fun.-Warp Core Sci FiThis was a great start to a great series.&#xA0; Steampunk-when written right-can be a grand adventure into the past that tells a whole new story of the ingenuity of the human mind.&#xA0; Thebanter between Eliza and Wellington, or &quot;Welly&quot; as she calls him, had me chuckling in more than one spot.--RomFan ReviewsI enjoyed this book more than I think I can express in a single review. The moment I finished it I wanted the next one in the series. The steampunk world is incredible, all the way from awesome weaponry to colorful clothing. Eliza's sassy attitude kept me upbeat throughout the entire book, even when I was scared for the characters' lives.-All About RomanceThis book combines aspects of the &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, the first three Indiana Jones movies, any good detective novel and the TV show, Cold Case...People love Steampunk and I think in Ballantine and Morris we have authors that can carry the torch.

{"asin": "0062049658", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Bell, influential pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church and author of Velvet Elvis, aims to provide an introduction to some of the big questions of Jesus' life and message. Claiming that some versions of Jesus should be rejected, particularly those used to intimidate and inspire fear or hatred, Bell persuasively interprets the Bible as a message of love and redemption. He is clearly well-versed in the scriptures, and for support his arguments look to everything from the parable of the prodigal son to Revelation to the story of Moses, in addition to his own personal experiences as a pastor, many of which are the book's highlights. Bell's vision of Christianity is inclusive, as he argues against some traditional ideas--for instance, hell as eternal punishment reserved for non-Christians--in favor of a God whose love and forgiveness is all encompassing. His style is characteristically concise and oral, his tone passionate and unabashedly positive. The result is a book that, while not exploring its own ideas deeply, may be a friendly welcome to Christianity for seekers, since they don't have a dog in the fight over hell that this book has ignited among the professionally religious.

But who said such a pursuit had to be boring? There were all manner of great stories hidden in the cabbage patch, from the daredevil biographies of botanists of yore to the mysterious manifestations of plant sex.

{"asin": "0062041282", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review. Dewitt's bang-up second novel (after Ablutions) is a quirky and stylish revisionist western. When a frontier baron known as the Commodore orders Charlie and Eli Sisters, his hired gunslingers, to track down and kill a prospector named Herman Kermit Warm, the brothers journey from Oregon to San Francisco, and eventually to Warm's claim in the Sierra foothills, running into a witch, a bear, a dead Indian, a parlor of drunken floozies, and a gang of murderous fur trappers. Eli's deadpan narration is at times strangely funny (as when he discovers dental hygiene, thanks to a frontier dentist dispensing free samples of \"tooth powder that produced a minty foam\") but maintains the power to stir heartbreak, as with Eli's infatuation with a consumptive hotel bookkeeper. As more of the brothers' story is teased out, Charlie and Eli explore the human implications of many of the clich&eacute;s of the old west and come off looking less and less like killers and more like traumatized young men. With nods to Charles Portis and Frank Norris, DeWitt has produced a genre-bending frontier saga that is exciting, funny, and, perhaps unexpectedly, moving. (May)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Alternating perspectives achieve striking visual effect--toys and animals loom large as seen through the stoic vision of the brave soldier; at other points during his perilous journey he appears as a mere sliver of blue and red amid the city's bustle. The soft glow of candlelight imparts a shadowy warmth to the interior scenes, which feature a gaggle of handsomely turned out children admiring their Christmas bounty. Seidler's ( A Rat's Tale ; The Tar Pit ) polished prose perfectly complements the artwork: \"The tin soldier was so touched that he would have shed tin tears--if he hadn't been in uniform. As it was, he just looked at her, and she looked at him, neither of them saying a word.\" Though perfect for the holiday season, this exquisite book may well stay on the shelf year-round.

A mother and father (of a furry, long-tailed, indeterminate species) search the house for their impish child; reflecting the right mixture of Toby's fantasy and the parents' willingness to enter into it, Steig's (The Toy Brother) text reports that the parents are \"just a tiny bit worried.\" Readers, meanwhile, can spot Toby hiding in each cozily decorated setting, although they may have to look closely. The grinning creature chooses some goofily improbable undercover positions: he's pictured atop a table on all fours, replacing the base of a Tiffany lamp; perched on the rooftop, ostensibly imitating a weather vane; and nestled among the grapes in a fruit bowl. Euvremer's (Sun's Up) quasi-pointillist art is not without flaws-it's overlit and the draftsmanship is uneven. But the pictures are nevertheless as playful as the family they picture, and they capture Toby's innocent sense of mischief.

An ungainly combination of Gulliver's Travels, the Christopher Columbus story and satire about Jewish retirees in Miami Beach, the narrative sends one Giuseppe Giaweeni from 15th- or 16th-century Italy across the sea in search of China; he lands in Miami. \"My-mom-mee?\" reads a voice bubble over one crewman's head. \"Me-hoo-mee?\" asks the dog, \"May-hem-mee?\" questions another traveler, and, in one of many bits of shtick, Giaweeni himself says, \"So I swerved a little.\" There they find \"a lost tribe of dancing giants\" known as the Mishbookers (how many readers will know that this name is related to the Yiddish word for \"family\"?). Giaweeni brings one Joe Mishbooker back to Europe to perform onstage (\"Where's the bathroom?\" asks the giant, squeezed into a palazzo, his head scraping the ceiling). But the audience flees the theater on Joe's opening night-are Yorinks and Sendak mocking the puniness of readers who fail to appreciate artists of great stature? Unfortunately, their collaboration is likely to merit much the same reception as Giaweeni and Joe's. Not even Sendak's superbly colored and operatically conceived illustrations can turn this in-joke into a story for public consumption.

Taffy MacDonald heads a family of 17 two daughters plus a pony, pig, dogs, cats and other assorted creatures, all of them sharing quarters in a barn (the picture of everyone sitting down to eat at a very long table is quintessential Day in its blend of realism and whimsy). When the postman retires, Taffy gets his job delivering the mail in the valley, and the whole family pitches in. Wordless spreads show the preparations: Taffy fits a mailbag onto the pony, a girl teaches a donkey how to alphabetize while her sister reads a book marked \"Door to door and so much more\" to an attentive dog and cat as other animals practice canceling stamps. The illustration of the multi-species carriers on their first day of the job has special charm somehow Day makes her mail-bearing cockatiel and parrot, her cart-pulling dog and the rest seem perfectly plausible in their roles. The story twists as Taffy's daughters realize that some people on their route never get any mail; to rectify that situation, they join with the animals and Taffy to prepare the \"special deliveries\" of the title.

{"asin": "0062049690", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Exclusive: A TALE OF PROVENCE: The story behindThe LanternI&rsquo;ve been having a love affair with Provence for more than 25 years. The light, the views, the colors, the heat&mdash;I find them all intoxicating. I went for the first time with the college boyfriend who would become my husband; his family had had a house in the Luberon for some twenty years. We finally bought our own property in France five years ago after my husband decided to give up banking and realize his long-held ambition to compose music.&ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo; (not the property&rsquo;s real name) is described inThe Lanternmore or less as we found it. Its setting is as accurate as I can make it without giving away its precise location. The Luberon area is one of the most sought-after locations in Provence, known for its hilltop villages, lavender, abundant fruit and clear bright light. It is the area Peter Mayle famously chronicled inA Year in Provence.In addition to the abandoned farming hamlet, the story has its roots in the lavender fields and perfume industry in the region. There are small lavender fields and tiny family-run lavender distilleries all around where we live, but the main centers are to the north in Sault and, as described in the novel, to the east at Manosque and the Valensole plateau.The idea of a blind perfumer came from the realization that there were strips of Braille on the packaging used by beauty product brand L&rsquo;Occitane en Provence, based at Manosque. In 1997 the company created the foundation Provence dans tous les Sens (All the Senses of Provence) to introduce visually-impaired children to the world of perfume creation. In the novel, Marthe Lincel finds her true talent as a perfume &ldquo;nose&rdquo; after a visit to the Distillerie Musset from the school for the blind she attends in Manosque, although this episode takes place in the 1930s.For most of the 20th century in this region, there was a gradual erosion of traditional farming as young people moved to the towns to seek work in the new industries and factories. The struggle was intense for those left behind on the hill farms in a region that was poor until the advent of mass tourism. InThe Lantern, as Pierre--the only brother--takes off for better-paid work, and Marthe finds increasing success in Paris, this is the struggle faced by B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte at &ldquo;Les Gen&eacute;vriers&rdquo;&mdash;and the past which gradually comes to disquiet Eve, the heroine of the contemporary narrative strand of the novel.Like Eve, I am an avid reader and worryingly prone to over-imagination. While at the house our first summer, camping on stone floors, I re-read Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;sRebecca, and was as captivated by it as ever--but my thoughts wandered... what if I had come to this place knowing less about the area, or perhaps, less about the man I was with?--Deborah LawrensonA Look InsideThe LanternClick on the images below to open larger versions.Lavender field in sunlightGarden door to the walnut wine cellarView from Gordes to the Luberon ridgeA room with a viewSide door into the alleyway", "title": "The Lantern: A Novel", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 810778}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51doSotJQTL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0058M6GBM", "B00CF6V0EW", "0062279661", "1608196976", "B007F84LWS", "0451209435", "0802135161", "0803236379", "0486277860", "0375727434", "0393311635", "0099481898", "0425213978", "081121379X", "0440420474", "B007K4KAIG", "014303894X", "0307347389", "1451655789", "0062119044", "0307716554", "1439152799", "0307718344", "B005FOGLZO", "1439152810", "1451672985", "B004LQ0E3C", "B00B9ZEJO8", "0316044938", "0143121162", "0143035746", "1573228710", "0061120065", "0385538553", "0099505193", "0316769495", "0486282406", "0061148512", "1250014506", "0451419480", "0062208365", "0385341008", "1605984973", "0452297907", "1250046394", "140003342X", "B0085SG4X6", "0307744426", "0679721886", "B009NPM8B2", "B00ANYD9YM", "0061120073", "1416550550", "0758278454", "0805091408", "1416550534", "0765356155", "0385538499", "0385527993", "0452297648"], "bought_together": ["B0058M6GBM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0058M6GBM", "B00CF6V0EW", "1416550550", "0440420474"]}}

One night, the lonely hunter hears the singing of a mermaid, and because &quot;he himself was as patient as an animal,&quot; the mermaid learns to trust him, speaking to him in a voice like the water. In time they teach each other their languages, with many amusing exchanges occurring as the hunter tries to teach his new friend terrestrial words and concepts.  The hunter explains, &quot;The house is a big wooden thing ... that you stay inside at night or when it rains.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; she asks. &quot;To keep from getting wet.&quot; &quot;To keep from gettingwet?&quot; the mermaid says despairingly.The mermaid and the hunter become a family when the hunter takes a bear cub from its mother to live with them as a son. &quot;The bear's table manners were bad. But so were the mermaid's--especially as she couldn't resist throwing the bear pieces of fish.&quot; Having a bear around seems perfectly normal, but not quite a complete family, so eventually the hunter captures a spotted baby lynx. When the lynx brings home not another dead partridge, but a little boy, the delicate, playful family dynamics change again. This book of low-key epiphanies is packed with delightful, illuminating, often unexpected comparisons of the ocean world and the land world most non-mermaids wouldn't have considered.

I can see how great it would be for a very short visit, and how great it would be if you lived there and had figured out what was and wasn&rsquo;t going to kill you, but the interim length of time isn&rsquo;t great.EG:Didn't I hear that you have a sort of magical story about a friend who is also a writer, who was also once going to write a book about the Amazon? Can you share this miraculous tale? Also, is your writer friend pretty?AP:This friend of mine, who happens to be you, is gorgeous, and much taller in real life.  Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie.   I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&rsquo;t worked out with you it came to me.   If this is true I think your name should be on the cover.  It would increase sales significantly.EG:Readers of your prior work--particularly the luminousBel Canto--will be delighted to see that opera makes an appearance in this novel, as well. In fact, one of the most dramatic scenes in the book takes place at the opera. Is that a wink and a nod to loyal readers, or just an expression of your own deep and abiding musical passions?AP:It&rsquo;s a wink and a nod to Werner Herzog and his brilliant Amazon film &ldquo;Fitzcarraldo&rdquo; which opens at the opera house in Manaus where the aforementioned scene takes place.  I had very little experience with opera when I wroteBel Canto, and since then it&rsquo;s become a huge part of my life.  It was fun to write a scene set at the opera now that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.EG:State of Wondera rollicking adventure story, full of peril and bravery and death-defying action. I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?AP:Ah, the life of the mind.  All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen.  I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds.  If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this.  I also love to write a strong plot.  I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled.  I always think about Raymond Chandler.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m getting the phrasing wrong but the general idea is that when things get slow, bring in a man with a gun.  If you can&rsquo;t find a gun, a poison arrow works just as well.EG:The cover is a work of beauty. Authors are not always so lucky. Tell us how you managed such a miracle?AP:When I first started writing this book, I came downstairs one night and found my husband listening to &ldquo;Horowitz at Carnegie Hall&rdquo;.  The album cover has a very lush filigreed border.  I had two thoughts: first, I have an amazing husband who thankfully held onto his Horowitz LPs; second, that the album cover had the exact the feeling I wanted for my book--half jungle, half Baroque period.  When I was finished writing the novel I sent the album to my editor, who sent it to the art department.  They understood exactly what I was talking about.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "State of Wonder: A Novel", "price": 8.61, "salesRank": {"Books": 5722}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UvReUP-LL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0061565318", "0156006219", "0547520204", "0060572159", "0812973992", "0062236679", "0061340642", "0547521898", "0060504080", "0061340650", "0307947726", "0062124277", "0316055433", "0060959037", "0205918395", "0061950726", "0060835273", "0143112155", "0307744418", "0312640994", "1439153663", "0375714367", "0316204269", "0452297753", "0060731338", "1451689772", "0307743721", "1451681755", "0060915188", "0981818137", "B005X4K3VE", "0199540160", "0030368162", "0679723226", "1133594379", "0205865771", "006273718X", "0307476073", "0143121162", "0316126675", "125001476X", "0307588378", "0399159347", "0316175668", "0142180823", "1580054463", "006224454X", "0679732411", "0316204366", "0679721827", "1400076218", "0618485228", "1616203161", "014242417X", "0349139636", "0060852585", "0393960129", "1476746583", "0312420277", "0670024856", "0143124544", "0679772669", "0316230847", "0061928178", "0345525558", "0812982622", "0307907767", "0060596996", "031625178X", "0143104918", "0345521315", "0307739783", "0670024783", "0062065254", "B007E69540", "0812980549", "0316176494", "1590514637", "0307278263", "0865477639", "0802853021", "140003437X", "140003342X", "1594632340", "081297932X", "0307455920", "0143125478", "0767929713", "140006922X", "0812980336", "0812971833", "0743298039", "0345528689", "125002417X", "0061941026", "0300166311", "081299289X", "1451648979"], "bought_together": ["0061565318", "0316055433"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061565318", "0812973992", "0061950726", "1476729093"]}}

Now, bark, George.\" But he quacks! Then oinks. Then moos. Becoming less patient and more exasperated, George's mom takes him to the vet, who reaches deep down inside the errant pup, and, much to everyone's surprise, pulls out a cat! Then a duck, a pig, and finally a cow. George is cured, and barks at last! On the way home, his proud mother wants to show off her convincingly doglike son to everyone on the street. But when she says, \"Bark, George,\" he simply says, \"Hello.\" This is the simplest offering yet from Jules Feiffer--creator of the delightful picture booksMeanwhileandI Lost My Bear. Still, hiscartoonish drawingsare intensely expressive, alive, and hilarious. None of it will be lost on the youngest of readers who will giggle every time George fails to bark, every time the vet extracts a new animal, and at the final punchline, too. In a world of often overdone or underdone picture books, this fine Feiffer creation is just right. (Click to see asample spread. Copyright 1999 by Jules Feiffer.

{"asin": "0062051423", "description": "Ballerina Noel (introduced in Nutcracker Noel) enjoys the most privileged place at the barre in her class. Along with first place comes pressure, however, and Noel loses her coveted spot to a new dancer, Anne Marie. Anne Marie in turn faces a challenge from a third girl, Regina Louisa Belinda. As Noel watches her foes spinning and leaping, she realizes they look \"like a pair of killer whales going after the same sardine.\" Competition has brought out their worst; seeing this, Noel recovers her own artistic balance and dances \"with all her heart, the way she used to do,\" thus regaining her teacher's favor. Kate McMullan accentuates Noel's initial vanity (\"Noel the First... that's me!\"), then comically ups the ante by giving Noel's competitors haughty demeanors. Jim McMullan, too, compares the lanky girls to society ladies, endowing them with ski-slope noses, sugary smiles and mannered postures (Regina even wears a tiara). The more prideful the girls' behavior, the harder and less graceful the images become; as Noel transcends the competition, blurry and delicate watercolor touches soften her features and make her look lighter than air.

Six classics in one book: \"Rumpelstiltskin,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Hansel and Gretel,\" \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" \"The Frog Prince,\" and \"Jack and the Beanstalk.\"  As retold by Jeanne Steig, however, these well-loved tales acquire a certain modern vim.  For example, the greedy King in Rumpelstiltskin is \"as happy as a hog with a herring\" to see all his straw spun into gold.  The mother of Beanstalk Jack has \"a dab of a garden, and an old cow called Blizzard, because she was as white as the milk she gave, except for a few spots to make her more interesting.\"  Although the vocabulary is generally simple, Steig doesn't shy away from words like \"sauntered\" and \"rapacious.\"  And the Frog-who-would-be-Prince, among other characters, regularly breaks into rhyming couplets.  Combined with 34 colorful, cartoony illustrations by William Steig, this gently ironic smattering of folktales will delight the grumpiest of readers.

In Eve, she escaped becoming a forced child-bearer only to discover that she had been specially marked by the King of New America and could not get away so easily. Here, she is being sheltered in an enclave for escaped women, another look at the series' theme of separation and distrust between the genders. When she is drawn out of her safe haven to search for her lost true love, Caleb, all does not go as planned. A twist quickly changes Eve's situation, but unfortunately fails to make her story any more probable. Likewise, detailed explanations of the formation of New America don't illuminate the story so much as reveal the poor foundation on which it is constructed. Interesting side characters are regularly shunted aside in favor of the bland protagonist and her cardboard love interest, and attempts to explore larger ideas fizzle before they develop.

Readers peek into a block of city apartments and find a diverse array of families heading to bed and trying to get their little ones to sleep in any way they can. When someone yells \"Pillow fight!\" things deteriorate rapidly, with kids hanging from their bunk beds, throwing their musical instruments out the window, and being calmed by exhausted, desperate adults. Hide-and-seek, asking for drinks and stories, and counting sheep finally give way to lights out, at which point somebody quietly asks, \"Pillow fight?\" Cornell's ink-and-watercolor cartoons work beautifully in scenes that range from close-ups to vignettes to detailed two-page paintings. The delightfully unique characters, dressed in wildly patterned pajamas and wearing an amazing array of expressions, seem to jump off the pages. The spread featuring a variety of parents in varying states of despair (begging, pulling out their hair, doing yoga, crying, standing on their head, and yelling) is particularly humorous. Although it probably won't lull anybody to sleep,Good Night Pillow Fightis a book that children and parents will want to enjoy together again and again.&ndash;Shelley B.

At 84, Teo Levin commands the dancers performing his choreography in the Tel Aviv Ballet with an authority and vigor that belies his age. He looks forward to his daily arguments about devotion and passion with 42-year-old artist Vivi, the waitress at a cafe he frequents. Vivi, aimless in the years since she fled preunified Berlin, finds her focus with Teo, at last. In turn, she forces him to share the secrets he's locked away about a shocking six-year period he endured as a young man in Nazi Germany. Fallenberg gives voice to the miasma of grief that overwhelms Teo and Vivi and achieves resonance in his exploration of music as a visual and physical experience. The author also manages to spin mundane discussions of passion and obsession into a rich narrative, skirting sentimentality. His spare style sneaks up on the reader, enhancing the emotionality inherent in his subject.

{"asin": "006204964X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Bell, influential pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church and author of Velvet Elvis, aims to provide an introduction to some of the big questions of Jesus' life and message. Claiming that some versions of Jesus should be rejected, particularly those used to intimidate and inspire fear or hatred, Bell persuasively interprets the Bible as a message of love and redemption. He is clearly well-versed in the scriptures, and for support his arguments look to everything from the parable of the prodigal son to Revelation to the story of Moses, in addition to his own personal experiences as a pastor, many of which are the book's highlights. Bell's vision of Christianity is inclusive, as he argues against some traditional ideas--for instance, hell as eternal punishment reserved for non-Christians--in favor of a God whose love and forgiveness is all encompassing. His style is characteristically concise and oral, his tone passionate and unabashedly positive. The result is a book that, while not exploring its own ideas deeply, may be a friendly welcome to Christianity for seekers, since they don't have a dog in the fight over hell that this book has ignited among the professionally religious.

Though the book is attractively designed with an easy-to-hold size and shape (6\" x 8\" lengthwise), the format begets some flaws. Each story has four or five single-page illustrations, but they are not plentiful enough to break up the many double-page spreads of solid text. Bold capital letters at the beginning of each sentence attempt to lighten the text density. The colorful illustrations carry Steig's familiar style but more coarsely caricature the well-known characters. His figures are definitely not genteel and seem more like peasantish rogues. Overall, they have less sprightliness and charm than the retellings.

{"asin": "006205905X", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Randall Jarrell'sThe Bat-Poetis the story of an artist. Although the bat-poet may look like a furry mouse with wings, he swells with an artistic sensibility. One day, he discovers how amazing it is to stay awake during daylight hours, exploring things mostly unseen by standard, nocturnal bats. But when he tries to get his bat friends to stay awake with him, they say, &quot;Day's to sleep in.&quot; And so the sensitive bat-poet is left alone to embrace the wonders of the day, including the fascinating activities of the possums, squirrels, chipmunks, and especially the mockingbird. The bat-poet attempts to sing a song like the mockingbird's, &quot;But when he tried, his high notes were all high and the notes in between were all high,&quot; so he imitates the mockingbird's words instead, and concocts poetry about how the sun &quot;shines like a million moons&quot; and other daytime marvels. Children will identify with the bat-poet's struggle to be understood, and adults will revel in Jarrell's artful prose and gentle wisdom. Maurice Sendak decorates more than illustrates the book with delicate, endearing pen-and-ink sketches of woodland scenes--the perfect complement to Jarrell's lyrical, philosophical, exquisitely spun fable.School Library Journalwrites, &quot;The totality charms by turns the eye, the ear, and the imagination, and as true poetry must, it satisfies the heart.&quot; (All ages)--Karin Snelson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "The Bat-Poet", "price": 7.19, "salesRank": {"Books": 275089}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HX48NjzWL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062059041", "0062050885", "0195134931", "0889843546", "0060533021", "0374513058", "0064430219", "0786814543", "0679889116", "0679883479", "1619490226", "0140157379", "0753453320", "0375866019", "0763624381", "0448401932", "0763626295", "0393958043", "0393972771", "0142404675", "0195139399", "0688155952", "0325007365", "1590170059", "0374339716", "0316058432", "0688137040", "068984882X", "006028479X", "0374323488", "081475855X", "0060530944", "067084487X", "0374423504", "0062050141", "0060255005", "1931492174", "0060527684", "006443205X", "0312380038", "0801889804", "0142407089", "0064400557", "0064405788", "0199538859", "1494915049", "0618007016", "0416031323", "1452131473", "0451419170", "0486284697", "0142410373", "0060287950", "0072819596", "0435088092", "0226393755", "0062234897", "0142402494", "0393092542", "1939228182", "0380709562", "0375714383", "1452106452", "0060576383", "0931722268", "0374444587", "0811824659", "0312371438", "0374479550", "0590470752", "0064431851", "1590174607", "0374530882", "1453782052", "0060266686", "0451167783", "0547199562", "0064460509", "0440400597", "0380807343", "076366040X", "0199938555", "0312371454", "1571103899", "0374316503", "1587171201", "0312371446", "0807508527", "0375847626", "0439098262", "0823410633", "0393926036", "0142407968", "031606002X", "0152025413", "006220307X", "0374468680", "0763621811", "0156724006", "0525444432"], "bought_together": ["0062059041"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062059041", "0679889116", "1453782052", "0374323488"]}}

This is a comprehensive system full of valuable insight and lessons aimed at creating the best work environment for the best people.ThroughoutThe Gifted Boss, Dale Dauten defines his different breed of leader as one who is able to shape a business environment and culture that is a magnet for self-motivated employees. Dauten's starting point is a powerful fact about hiring great employees: the best ones are almost never in the job market. His system also includes a discussion of \"ideal turnover\" and how the great managers employ \"the secret skill\" of \"de-hiring\" to gracefully move mediocre employees up or out. Throughout his discussions, Dauten incorporates priceless knowledge gained from an exhaustive search for America's best bosses. The wisdom he acquired was startling, and it pertained to every type of organization: \"Different isn't always better, but better is always different.\"The Gifted Bosshas already earned itself a cult following. Now, based on conversations with hundreds of readers, Dauten has revised his work by adding a quick-start guide to help his audience get fast results and a discussion guide to help executives share the book with their teams.

One morning Zeke Pippin, a young pig, is moseying down the street when a harmonica falls off of a garbage truck, right in front of him. He takes it home, cleans it, and begins to play up a storm. He is a natural, soon regaling his family with the prelude toLa Traviata. His family is very proud of him, but they instantly fall asleep upon hearing his tranquilizing tune. Zeke is indignant at their apparent rudeness and runs away from home, drifting down the Hinkaholly River on his trusty raft. Eventually, as he zeezles and zoozles on his harmonica, he notices that, judging by the effect his music has on other animals, he is in possession of a supernatural, sleep-inducing instrument. Zeke is sheepish. He can't believe he doubted the manners--the very integrity--of his family, who by now must miss him horribly: &quot;He knew he must bring them a surcease of their sorrow, as swiftly as possible, and clear up this painful misunderstanding.&quot; Getting home, however, is not easy, and as it turns out, downright dangerous, but he successfully bamboozles his way until he finally faints upon the doormat of home sweet home. Zeke's family is overjoyed, and soon their boy becomes famous (more celebrated than the mayor) and everyone lives happily, musically ever after.

The Grimjinxes are released when a prophecy woven into a tapestry predicts that they will save the city of Vengekeep from a variety of disasters. The tapestry is revealed to have been planted by Jaxter's parents, but soon all of the predicted disasters start happening. The family discovers that the false tapestry was inadvertently woven out of fateskin, a magical substance that will make all of the false predictions come true and is almost impossible to destroy. Jaxter's interest in herbal remedies to counter magic might hold an answer for how to destroy the fateskin, so he and his friend Callie set off on a quest to find the exotic and magical ingredients and save Vengekeep, meeting both allies and enemies as they race against time to save their city. Farrey creates a world filled with interesting characters and a detailed background culture, including sayings and words in the ancient par-Goblin language now used by thieves, including the Grimjinxes. Jaxter's parents, grandmother, and sister are fully realized and entertaining characters who have many illegal talents. The nonstop action and danger will draw in fantasy and adventure fans and may appeal to reluctant readers as well.

{"asin": "0062050141", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Grade 2 Up-Sendak is back, bolder than ever, as he looks out to the problems of today's world. He combines two little-known and unrelated nursery rhymes, taking advantage of their absence of story to interpret them with a wealth of detail and social commentary. In so doing, his visual images invite readers to become co-conspirators in the creation of the tale. From the dust jacket's ragged and newspaper-wrapped children, depicted within a monstrous mouth that readers will discover is the moon, to the very last page, one must search for clues to bring meaning to the enigmatic text. (Most are in the form of newspaper headlines). The homeless children and kittens are watched over by the moon, which seems to insist that the youngsters take care of one another. The moon itself is transformed into a giant cat to save the kittens and a baby from the rats who steal them. Unlike Max from Where the Wild Things Are (HarperCollins, 1988), however, their return is not to safety and a warm supper, but to the uncertainties of the street. Overall, the images refer to poverty, war, crime, pollution, famine, inflation, AIDS, unemployment, and other current evils. The illustrations themselves are not frightening, but they remind readers of horrific things in the real world. The somewhat muted and subdued palette is brightened with bursts of red sky and a stark white cat, which give an explosive energy to the story. The clarity of the art and of the composition of the pages are deceptively simple. The rhythms of the street, of rap music, are recognizable in the interplay between the rhymes and characters' ballooned comments. This is a potent, evocative book, but Sendak respects children's ability to deal with powerful and potentially controversial issues and ideas. We Are All in the Dumps will lead to discussion, speculation, and a variety of interpretations, all of which are appropriate for this type of allegory.

{"asin": "0062051717", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Wolves and pigs have always been excellent fodder for suspenseful children's stories, andSwine Lakeproves it once again, this time in the masterful hands of the late James Marshall and Maurice Sendak. Marshall wrote the book fully intending to illustrate it himself, but when he died in 1992, his good friend Sendak was charged with the challenging task of bringing this delightful work to life. And come to life it does! The rollicking tale opens with a mangy, hungry wolf on the prowl in an unfamiliar part of town. Soon the wolf's nose twitches uncontrollably. He smells pigs! Just across the street is a theater marquee bearing the wordsSwine Lake. Boarshoi Ballet.The wolf can scarcely conceal his  delight, and \"soon the aroma of pig, thinly disguised by French perfume, was making him swoon.\"Snatching matinee tickets from a swanky ticket-scalping sow who arrives in a limousine, he enters the theater. \"Had the ticket taker been more observant, he would have noticed the long claws and much that follows could have been avoided,\" Marshall adds parenthetically. The wolf is escorted by a distracted usher to his box seat, just a short pounce from the stage. When the show begins, the wolf ponders which might be the juiciest pig. But as he assesses the probable quality of the pork, he begins to get lost in the magical story, and decides to put off his attack until act 2... and in fact forgets to make his move altogether. That very night he breaks into his piggy bank and spends his last penny on a ticket for the evening performance ofSwine Lake.Anyone who is familiar withSwan Lakewill be positively giddy to behold Marshall and Sendak's porcine take on this well-known ballet, but certainly no cultural context is necessary to appreciate the simple plot. With a winning story about the power of the theater to soothe the hungriest, toothiest of beasts, this fabulous team has made an absolutely historic contribution to children's literature. Fans will see a lighter, funnier side to Sendak than they've seen before, as Marshall's comic spirit gently guides his paintbrush and pens.  (Click to see asample spread.

{"asin": "0062046349", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "\"My mother was crazy. My mother went crazy. I'm not sure which of these statements is true; perhaps both are,\" Gwin writes. Weaving together childhood diary entries, old letters and poems, Gwin, an English professor at Purdue, traces her mother's unraveling from a young parent to an emotionally unstable, even dangerous, older woman. Erin Taylor hailed from a well-to-do Mississippi family with skeletons in the closet: the suicides of Gwin's great-grandfather and great-aunt. \"Erin Taylor was considered eccentric and difficult to get along with by people who knew her well and people who had known her in passing,\" Gwin notes. As Erin's mental illness progressed, she suffered from anorexia, prescription drug abuse and other irrational behaviors, including leaving raw meat out to rot. After Erin's death from ovarian cancer, Gwin tries to piece together why her mother was so disturbed. Gwin explicates her relationship with her mother and dissects her decline through innumerable recollections. She doesn't search out a particular moment, a recapitulating event or a single theory of her mother's disease. Instead, she stumbles over her life's interactions with Erin, spending a good deal of time exorcising her guilt over twice committing her mother to psychiatric hospitals. Though Gwin's memoir is a deeply personal account of dealing with mental illness, she fails to convey anything larger, getting caught up in her mother's barbs and behavior. The book opens with a fairly detailed family history, but living relatives-including Gwin's siblings-are noticeably absent from the story, making it less full than it might have been.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "006205094X", "description": "Kindergarten-Grade 3.  When Grandpa Lev's horse becomes too old to pull his peddler's wagon, the elderly man purchases Max, a music-loving creature, since the fire department's acquisition of two new engines has made his job as a fire horse obsolete. It seems like a perfect plan, except that every time the fire bells sound, Max takes off, scattering Grandpa Lev's goods all over town. Lev, once a musician in a famous orchestra in the old country, finally solves the problem by playing his violin to soothe the horse whenever he is tempted to run to a fire. Arnold's watercolor, cartoon-style illustrations evoke life in a small Vermont town at the turn of the century. The dress of its inhabitants (long gowns, hats, parasols, cutaway coats, suspenders, middie-blouses, and high-buttoned shoes); the peddler's wagon stuffed with goods; the unpaved streets; and the small shops all contribute to the sense of place and time. The text, too, presents a small, close-knit community where neighbors know and support one another. However, although Lev has to make more than one attempt to solve his problem with his new horse, the solution seems to come too quickly, and the story suffers a bit from a lack of tension.

Why is life so cruel? Why do people like to hurt each other?\" But a mere three months later--after moving into her own apartment, taking a job as a topless dancer, and becoming addicted to heroin--her tone takes on that of a grizzled drug abuser: \"I've been shooting in my bony hip area... toward my groin, so no one can detect the needle points on my rear when I wear my G-string, and I'm getting terribly numb there.\" Samantha's story is told entirely in the form of her journal entries, which vividly reflect this young woman's rapid descent into the seedy world of addiction.Author Linda Glovach creates a likable, believable character in Samantha: we recognize her humanity as a girl genuinely troubled by her mother's alcoholism (as well as by her mom's lascivious boyfriend); we feel the unconditional love she harbors for her diabetic Maine coon cat; we shake our heads as her greed for money and flippant attitude about her addiction cause Sam to make naive decisions. As Sam spirals further downward--still unaware of how far gone she really is, even though she can't complete a journal entry without shooting up--readers will feel the remorse of what could have been, and may learn a valuable lesson in the process.

{"asin": "0062049488", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Menzies, a former sailor in the British Royal Navy, has carved a lucrative literary career by seizing upon a few tantalizing facts and then making gigantic leaps to unwarranted conclusions. Previously he has asserted that a Chinese admiral &#x201C;discovered&#x201D; America and sparked the Renaissance by visiting Italy. In the process, of course, he has infuriated professional historians. Here Menzies turns his attention to the ancient Mediterannean and the Minoan civilization that flourished on the island of Crete in the second millennium B.C. Again using the flimsiest of evidence, he asserts that this Bronze Age, highly localized culture was linked to the mythical &#x201C;lost continent&#x201D; of Atlantis, which was at the center of an immense global trading empire extending north to Britain and west to North America. Still, this will be a fun book for some. It includes brave, adventurous mariners and a dramatic natural disaster (probably the most accurate of Menzies&#x2019; claims).

Now, in this staggeringly intimate memoir, Eldon lays bare not only her shock and grief over the devastating circumstances of her son&#x2019;s death but also the details of her failed marriage, her regretted indiscretions, and her struggle to find her own true purpose beyond wife-and-motherhood.

She acknowledges skepticism of these matters, however, and describes her encounters with the same straightforwardness with which she reveals ill-fated matters of the heart.

Unbeknownst to her friends and love interest, Sam, Janan the Destroyer has been consuming new souls so that his followers from thousands of years ago may continue to be reborn. If he is freed from the temple and \"ascends,\" his supporters will become immortal while the land will be destroyed by catastrophic earthquakes&#x2014;a plot point Meadows reiterates. As a \"nosoul,\" Ana has been exiled from the city of Heart. Her loyal friends have decided to leave with her, as well as the ethereal sylph who also wishes to see Janan's downfall. The group's journey is challenging, as they must face a mixed bag of interesting (mythological) creatures while trying to figure out how to hinder Janan's plan. Ana and Sam's relationship is strained when he learns she has not been completely truthful with him, but they have a steamy reconciliation once he realizes her motives. The final scenes are action packed and intense. Fans of the series should find the conclusion satisfactory, though it's a long journey getting there.&#x2014;Sherry J.

In the summer before her senior year, preparing for her oldest sister&#x2019;s wedding, she wakes up to the fact that she wants no part of the perfect life her mother has orchestrated for her. A major part of that is her handsome, football-star boyfriend, whose advances she&#x2019;s been fending off for months. The catalyst for these realizations is a chance encounter with the valet-parking boy at the country club, with whom Leah has not only serious chemistry but also honest affection. Although there are plenty of steamy but nongraphic groping sessions, it&#x2019;s the strong character development that drives Meredith&#x2019;s first novel. Leah is cynical, self-aware, and breaking free from a stifling future while learning how to better understand her family. Meredith also displays a great ear for teen interior monologues in Leah&#x2019;s compelling first-person narrative. Readers will delight in Leah&#x2019;s transformation from wealthy, privileged brat to a young woman ready to take chances and live her own life.

{"asin": "0062060619", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012: Betrayal, ardor, war, and prophecies--inThe Song of Achilles, author Madeline Miller brings together everything I love aboutThe Iliadwithout the labor of epic poetry.  In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair.The Song of Achillesinfuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next.--Seira WilsonGregory Maguire Interviews Madeline MillerGregory Maguire is the best-selling author ofConfessions of an Ugly Stepsister,Lost,Mirror Mirror,the Wicked Years, a series that includesWicked,Son of a Witch,A Lion Among Men, and most recently,Out of Oz.Gregory Maguire:Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia,The Iliadhas garnered somewhat wider attention thanThe Wizard of Oz, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?Madeline Miller:A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&mdash;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&rsquo;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.Maguire:The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?Miller:Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&mdash;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself.  He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.Maguire:Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?Miller:It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&mdash;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.Maguire:Oscar Wilde said something like, &ldquo;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&rdquo; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you. This is not a question.

Alas, no one remembers the poor fellow. Worse yet, his mission seems to be old news?he spies a neglected exhibit at the Museum of Intergalactic Exploration displaying a space suit, rock-collecting sack and moon specimens identical to his. Observant youngsters will gasp when the dejected astronaut throws his sack of rocks into a trash can, for they know something he doesn't. In Agee's title page art, they've seen Lulu, Dmitri's pink, polka-dotted lunar pal, scurrying into the bag before his liftoff from the moon. Thanks to the long-snouted Lulu, who has a knack for producing art any preschooler will find very familiar, the forgotten space explorer finally gets the recognition he knows he deserves. The wry humor of Agee's clever book springs in equal measure from the minimal, tongue-in-cheek text and adroitly exaggerated cartoon illustrations. The telltale particulars Agee tucks into his pictures let kids fill in the blanks?and keeps them a step or two ahead of his Chaplinesque hero.

{"asin": "0062062824", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 9 Up&#x2013;This fast-paced sequel to The Lost Code (HarperCollins, 2012) reads like a combination of Star Trek, Rick Riordan's The Lightning Thief, and Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games. Owen is a descendant of the ancient Atlanteans and has the power to find an almost-extinct technology that will reverse climate change. Wanting that secret for himself, Paul, who is the evil head of the Elysium Project,&#xA0;is determined to find Owen and his friends, Leech and Lilly, and use the teen's secret for his own purposes. In order to evade the villain and find Atlantis, the three travel by aircraft across the barren wasteland of what used to be the United States. They encounter dead bodies fallen by pandemics and numerous other horrors. They meet untrustwothy people, but finally form an alliance with the Benevolent Mother, the leader of a cult who tries to help them with their mission. The plot twists around like a vine, blending mythology, technology, pandemics, violence, and excitement. The three main characters are likable, though they all seem to have nine lives. This second installment will appeal to dystopian fans as well as to students who can keep track of the many subplots.&#x2013;Kathy Lyday, South Caldwell High School, NC&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

{"asin": "0062060783", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 8 Up-This novel picks up right where Incarnate (HarperCollins, 2012) leaves off. The citizens of Heart are still reeling from the terror of Templedark, and Ana's future in the community is uncertain to say the least. She is living with Sam, and they are learning to harmonize both in their lives and in their music. Ana's flute playing seems to have an effect on more than just Sam; a frightening and dangerous sylph seems to be drawn to and hypnotized by it. Once again, the innovation in the world-building is impressive; Meadows has sustained the mythology of Heart and delves deeper into the questions of human existence, foundations of worship, and the dangers of groupthink. It sounds like more than one would expect from a dystopian/othernormal romance, but it's a perfect match to its predecessor. While not a stand-alone novel, Asunder is definitely more meaty than many follow-up books.

Blending perceptive analysis with concise narrative, he describes the Civil War as America's defining experience both for the causes involved and for the tremendous human and material costs. Stokesbury makes a solid case that participants thought the war was worth the effort and the sacrifice. Southerners convinced themselves they had intended less to preserve slavery than to leave an oppressive system. Northerners fought for \"a new birth of freedom,\" a redefining of the meaning of \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" Both sides were proud enough of themselves that they could ultimately be Americans again.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "A Short History of the Civil War", "price": 11.22, "salesRank": {"Books": 423419}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519x6NxjUdL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["068812304X", "0688085873", "0688001297", "0452290163", "0688095135", "1599820773", "0028183037", "0547336977", "0131366262", "157075666X", "1400033152", "0486298833", "1583335234", "0060921072", "0321689577", "1118018699", "0142002836", "0700608850", "0312552017", "1570752451", "0140296387", "0299217744", "1400078776", "0321814061", "0061319295", "0765321785", "013142064X", "1416505490", "0060652934", "0226768686", "0156881802", "0824509080", "0451531604", "0385476345", "0312415990", "0140714804", "1890177695", "0205851630", "006206102X", "1400032717", "0062067753", "0824507223", "013137544X", "0743477103", "0486284727", "0345447980", "0060964316", "0078279992", "020511671X", "111142764X", "0688021344", "1429215976", "B00004XPPG", "038572179X", "0688050611", "1602391807", "0470426411", "0842029451", "1599821397"], "bought_together": ["0452290163"], "buy_after_viewing": ["019516895X", "068812304X", "0486297020", "0688085873"]}}
{"asin": "0062050664", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In this abbreviated version of the Grimms' \"The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs,\" a crown-shaped birthmark heralds a boy's bright future. Based on this omen, a fortuneteller predicts that Marco will marry a princess, and this comes to pass in short order: \"So the two were married, with plenty of joy and noise, and that should have been the end of it. But it wasn't.\" The youth still must placate his evil father-in-law, the king, who demands three golden hairs from the head of the Devil. Marco ventures forth to Hell, where he meets the Devil's impish grandmother, who agrees to yank the three hairs. (\"Ouch!\" is the Devil's exclamation as she does the deed.) Thus, he keeps the princess, and then exacts revenge on the king. Babbitt (Bub) rewrites the classic story in a casual voice infused with wry wit, paring it down to its essentials (e.g., leaving out the magical golden apples and wine-flowing fountain), while Marcellino (The Story of Little Babaji) paints the characters in picturesque Renaissance-era garb. He constructs scenes of architectural grandeur: readers become spectators at the wedding, looking up at the starry ceiling, and stand alongside the newly married prince at the steps of Hell, which appears as a desolate castle with firelit bricks and oversize wooden furniture. The Devil himself is a slim, none-too-threatening figure in a red unitard decorated with ruffles at the wrist. The inventive layout, based on a rectangular grid, features creatively cropped and overlapping color images and blocky text. Although things come together a bit too easily in this Grimm tale, readers will likely lap up Babbitt's intelligent retelling, mixed with a dash of sly humor and dressed in Marcellino's signature finery.

Despite readers&#x2019; familiarity with the story line, they will be held rapt as Gemma Hardy, orphaned at age 10, is taken in by a loving uncle only to lose him, too. Her aunt so cruelly shuns her in the wake of her uncle&#x2019;s death that she looks forward to attending boarding school, but her status as a working girl means that she has little time for her schoolwork, often laboring to the point of exhaustion. Still, Gemma&#x2019;s high intelligence and fierce resolve see her through many difficult experiences until she lands a dream job as an au pair on the isolated yet beautiful Orkney Islands.

{"asin": "0062063952", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "In a departure for Creech, whose previous novels have all been set in the present day, the Newbery Medal winner offers a good-hearted, gently comic fairy tale set in feudal Italy. Using parallel stories that eventually dovetail, Creech introduces the Castle Corona's sheltered, slightly ridiculous royal family and Pia and Enzio, orphaned peasant children from the nearby village. Brief, cleverly paced episodes reveal that several fixtures of castle life&#x97;the king and queen's respective hermit advisors, and the court storyteller&#x97;subtly engineer Pia and Enzio's appointment as royal food tasters, for purposes linked to a stolen pouch found by the children early on. The novel's many characters are more allegorical than flesh-and-blood, and the hasty revelations at story's end don't entirely satisfy. But the engaging, puzzlelike plot will attract readers, as the novel's heady themes, from wisdom to empathy to the fate-changing power of story, prompt them to deeper thought. Diaz's full-color chapter-heading artwork and ornamental flourishes lend the novel substantial aesthetic appeal.

InThat's Not What I Meant!, the internationally renowned sociolinguist and expert on communication demonstrates how our conversational signals&#8212;voice level, pitch and intonation, rhythm and timing, even the simple turns of phrase we choose&#8212;are powerful factors in the success or failure of any relationship. Regional speech characteristics, ethnic and class backgrounds, age, and individual personality all contribute to diverse conversational styles that can lead to frustration and misplaced blame if ignored&#8212;but provide tools to improve relationships if they are understood.At once eye-opening, astute, and vastly entertaining, Tannen's classic work on interpersonal communication will help you to hear what isn't said and to recognize how your personal conversational style meshes or clashes with others. It will give you a new understanding of communication that will enable you to make the adjustments that can save a conversation . . . or a relationship.", "title": "That's Not What I Meant!: How Conversational Style Makes or Breaks Relationships", "price": 10.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 19853}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xaK3InKvL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0060959622", "0380717832", "0345407520", "081297266X", "158333291X", "0061097535", "0874777518", "067162248X", "0521426057", "0425138704", "0831400706", "0143118447", "0073385131", "0078035171", "0688078222", "0415908086", "0757578756", "0688149499", "1931930260", "0820452963", "0345407512", "0684854481", "0226645037", "0440413052", "047061353X", "0062015044", "067400390X", "1575240971", "0787964638", "1563683091", "0345496973", "0679456015", "0195221818", "0981509029", "0935028161", "0521868904", "0201741571", "0826458017", "0521295939", "0072855355", "0898276780", "0830834559", "1400062586", "B0043GXXUQ", "0787974838", "039331068X", "0324654367", "0156482401", "0253205107", "0830844031", "1563683520", "0688112439", "1565490576", "0061319821", "0745649742", "0133949737", "0787964468", "0826495710", "0316069884", "0195101243", "1423901789", "0969779240", "089079927X", "0988953803", "0897933524", "0865717222", "019974758X", "0787964344", "0813533716", "1931930228", "1563685078", "0195319907", "0071771328", "1561483907", "1892005034", "0915035901", "042512780X", "0470922249", "0143038257", "0199735719", "0195180941", "0553371312", "0521097126", "1904838022", "019504231X", "0205386024", "0073534315", "1576759709", "0470189479", "1561485071", "0916883329", "0226671844", "0807737003", "0674004329", "0205246532", "0226043789", "0131058452", "0787976237", "111134910X", "0534643833"], "bought_together": ["0060959622", "0380717832"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060959622", "0345379721", "081297266X", "B002PJ4J1A"]}}

Despite readers&#x2019; familiarity with the story line, they will be held rapt as Gemma Hardy, orphaned at age 10, is taken in by a loving uncle only to lose him, too. Her aunt so cruelly shuns her in the wake of her uncle&#x2019;s death that she looks forward to attending boarding school, but her status as a working girl means that she has little time for her schoolwork, often laboring to the point of exhaustion. Still, Gemma&#x2019;s high intelligence and fierce resolve see her through many difficult experiences until she lands a dream job as an au pair on the isolated yet beautiful Orkney Islands. There she meets the family that will change her life (minus the madwoman in the attic).

British-born Alice, whose marriage to Marchese Claudio Orsini palls after the excitement of restoring their rundown country estate, named San Martino, embarks on a long-term affair with a childhood friend, whose comfort she seeks as her young son, Giovanni, dies of meningitis. Claudio, unable to comprehend Alice&#x2019;s absence from their dying son&#x2019;s bedside, vanishes, leaving Alice to manage the estate as the German occupying forces approach. Art student Kristin, who falls in love, in Rome, with her married mentor and employer, art expert and restorer Robert Marshall, executes the perfect postaffair artistic revenge, which ultimately takes her to San Martino, which now shelters partisans, escaped Allied prisoners of war, and more. With a backdrop of the ravages of WWII, particularly as they affect the civilian population, Olafsson casts a keen eye on Germany&#x2019;s wartime acquisition of artistic masterpieces.

The title tale, set on the banks of the Nile, features a dapper set of pelican parents who marry off their daughter to the king of the cranes, then fear they will never see her again.

{"asin": "0062064320", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The nearly identical suicides of two students at a prestigious private school, both involving stolen handguns, pique the interest of LAPD Lieutenant Detective Pete Decker and his squad. But the focus here is less on Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus, than on Gabe Whitman, the son of a friend who&#x2019;s living with them temporarily. Gabe, a 15-year-old musical prodigy, also has street smarts learned from his mobster father, Chris Donatti, that stand him in good stead when he&#x2019;s &#x201C;crowded&#x201D; and threatened by the clique called the B&amp;W Mafia. Home-schooled Gabe also falls head-over-heels in love with 14-year-old Yasmine Nourmand. While the reciprocal relationship is grounded in love of music (plus raging hormones), it appears doomed by cultural and religious differences. Plot threads intertwine head-on in a violent confrontation, eventually tying up most loose ends extremely satisfactorily. The twentieth Decker/Lazarus novel shows Kellerman in fine form, taking on the au courant issue of bullying, in a slick, fast-moving mystery that should entice even those new to the series.

{"asin": "0062060023", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Jon Scieszka Interviews Adam RexJon Scieszka is the National Ambassador for Children&rsquo;s Literature emeritus and the bestselling author of more than 25 books for kids, includingThe Stinky Cheese ManandOther Fairly Stupid Tales,Math Curse,Robot Zot!, and theTime Warp Trioseries. Jon founded Guys Read to encourage a passion for reading among young boys, with the philosophy that boys love to read most when they are reading things they love.Jon Scieszka:Cold Cerealis the only novel I have ever read that combines Celtic folklore, cryptozoology, Arthurian legends, codes and puzzles, Freemasonry, dragon biology, TV cereal commercials, Shakespeare, and a rough outline for the musical version ofHuckleberry Finn. How did that happen?Adam Rex:Honestly? After my last novel (Fat Vampire) I wanted to get back to writing for a middle-grade audience, and I had, like, six or seven possible novels already started to some degree or another. And I began to notice some connective tissue between a few of them. My idea about the twins who are test subjects in a sinister experiment had an evil breakfast cereal company in it. The one about the kid who catches a leprechaun trying to steal his backpack in a bus station restroom had a character who&rsquo;s at home both in ancient folklore and cereal commercials. The one about the modern-day pop-star knight who has to slay a dragon and the one about a time-traveling Merlin had European folklore connections, too. So I started mashing them all together and found they complemented each other better than they had any right to. And then I added a musical Huck Finn.Scieszka:In writing so extensively about leprechauns and clurichauns, unicorns and unicats, goblins and pookas and other assorted Fair Folk&hellip; don&rsquo;t you worry that you might have revealed too much? About both Queen Titania&rsquo;s court and your middle-school reading history?Rex:Ha! (Cough.) Yes. My middle-school reading history was pretty dire, actually, as practically everything I read outside of school was some officially licensed Dungeons &amp; Dragons novel. Which is to say: I read a lot of fantasy, but I didn't even read any good fantasy. To this day I still haven't readThe Lord of the Rings, which is, of course, the basis for everything I liked in middle school until I discovered comic books.And the really stupid thing is: seventh-grade me probably would have resented a lot of what I try to get away with inCold Cereal. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what goblins are like,&rdquo; I would have said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a unicat.&rdquo; But I think I would have read it anyway for the humor because I was also big in Douglas Adams at the time. And still am.Scieszka:Two two-part questions: What is the best or worst cereal commercial you&rsquo;ve ever seen? And why? What is your most favorite or most hated breakfast cereal? And why?Rex:As a kid I actually wasn&rsquo;t allowed any of the kind of &ldquo;sugar cereals&rdquo; that the Goodco Cereal Company makes in my book. Which is probably why the commercials made such an impression on me. I was like Lancelot, offered a glimpse of the Sangrail but not allowed to enter into its presence. You see what I did there? Tied together breakfast cereal and the Arthurian legends? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;staying on point.&rdquo;I think the worst commercial I ever saw was an eighties spot for Apple Jacks. A group of girls are sitting around talking about how great Apple Jacks are, as girls do, and the main girl&rsquo;s dad butts in and asks why the girls like them if they don&rsquo;t even taste like apples. The girls look at one another, stumped and flustered, until the daughter blurts out, &ldquo;We just do, okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Dad shrugs and leaves. And when he&rsquo;s out of earshot, the main girl tells her friends, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s old,&rdquo; and they all giggle. Even as a kid I knew this commercial failed on every level.My favorite cereal commercial was anytime there was a crazy mix-up at the Crunchberry factory.Scieszka:The brother and sister spats and tricks between Erno and Emily and Scott and Polly are so real that I have to ask: Do you have an annoying younger, older, or twin sister?Rex:Iwasthe annoying younger brother. But we got along better than most. I also have a sister who's twelve years younger&mdash;too young to have been a source of any conflict in my life. If anything, I wanted my younger sister to tag along on my outings&mdash;I got more attention from teenage girls when she did.I think I developed my sense of sibling rivalry from watching my childhood best friend&rsquo;s family. They fought so much they even had their own family-only derogatory term for each other: &ldquo;buh.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re being a buh,&rdquo; they&rsquo;d tell a brother or sister who was judged at that moment to be difficult or annoying. It&rsquo;s an excellent word and one I hope to teach to my own children someday.Scieszka:The briefly described musical ofHuckleberry Finnsounds perfectly awful. Can you share any more details aboutOh Huck!with us?Rex:Well, as the book says, the play&rsquo;s narrator is a talking raft (Riff-Raft), and it features a rapping scarecrow. I also imagine it to be the sort of Julie Taymor&ndash;inspired production where the Mississippi is represented by a hundred dancers in leotards doing the worm or whatever. And in our supposedly post-racial society, Jim is played by Nathan Lane. But that&rsquo;s all I can say about it.Scieszka:What more can you tell us about the next two books in this promised &ldquo;Magically Delicious New Trilogy&rdquo;?Rex:In book two,Unlucky Charms,my heroes will travel to England, attempt to expose the queen as two goblins in a queen suit, travel to the enchanted isles of Pretannica to plead for humanity from Queen Titania herself, and possibly slay a dragon while they&rsquo;re there. Along the way they&rsquo;ll accidentally ingest the Salmon of Knowledge; learn the true history of Arthur, King of the Britons; and if I have time, face the unspeakable terror of the Ronopolisk.

Getting her best friend murdered while investigating Las Vegas's men of power swiftly unearths a city-wide conspiracy that preys on the vulnerable and innocent, one propagated by an ugly circle of zealous adherence to traditions and enforced by selective blindness and lethal corrections.Drawn into bringing the horrific abuse to light, Kit puts her own life into the equation.  But she's supposed to be dead already, according to Grif, a jaded angel whose job it was to get Kit's friend to the Everlast.  Grif's own scars made by failing to protect his wife from a savage murder he was blamed for keep him tied to his Everlast job, unable to move on, unable to look back.Shaken by Kit's dual strong and fragile nature, Grif begins breaking rules, setting up larger and larger waves through the Everlast as he finds every moment he spends with Kit brings him closer to the truth he has been avoiding the past seventy years--and he slowly realizes that even an angel can learn to love again.Boldly exploring topics skirting today's headlines, Pettersson deftly brings together a cast of unique yet recognizable characters within her hometown of Las Vegas.  Fast paced and having logical surprises,The Takenis an exceptional look into a vision of what happens when the hereafter merges with the here-and-now, the mechanics of the world building as unique and satisfying as the tale itself as the genres of mystery, crime scene drama, and more than enough romance to keep the heart pumping blend seamlessly into an enthralling read that kept me glued to the pages until the final, satisfying end.

Instead of being guided through the finer points of bond trading, however, Alex is initially given tasks mostly centered on taking lunch orders and keeping everyone&#x2019;s nicknames straight. As she is accorded more responsibility, the realities of the financial industry and the mostly male egos around her conspire to make her job a little more difficult than she anticipated. Like The Devil Wears Prada (2003) set on Wall Street, Duffy&#x2019;s first novel is a sharp, witty look at the intricacies of the trading floor and the people who populate it. The writing is clever and articulate, and Alex&#x2019;s story of personal growth makes her a sympathetic, likable heroine. Filled with too-good-to-be-true anecdotes and enough of a biting, cynical bent to offset the chick-lit romance angle, Bond Girl is a fun read-alike to the canons of Weisberger, Kinsella, and Green. Duffy&#x2019;s acknowledgment of the recent financial collapse and ensuing recession makes Bond Girl an entertaining and timely read. --Stephanie Turza", "title": "Bond Girl: A Novel", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 798561}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ngXr9fyyL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AZ857G4", "B00B1L98PK", "1250028396", "1439136637", "0307743691", "0062205749", "0812993845", "0451419448", "0385536976", "1401324541", "0399159347", "0316204269", "B005K6SONY", "0312544367", "1410448940", "B0058M8O6M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0143122754", "0307588378", "1451627491", "0316204269"]}}

Falling asleep, she dreams of Santa giving her a ride on his sled, during which he gives her two turtledoves and all the rest of the traditional gifts in the song. Arriving back at his workshop, he repairs the broken gift, and the girl wakes up to Christmas morning to a wrapped-up, unbroken snow globe. The dream setting of Santa's sleigh above snowy rooftops makes as good a backdrop as any for those odd gifts, from fussy French hens to swans startling the milkmaids and their cows (all wearing fluffy bonnets). Families looking for a singable version of the song will be disappointed, but they will likely enjoy the story and the exuberant, oversize illustrations.-Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Faith and her husband, Reverend Tom, are in Italy to celebrate an anniversary and attend a weeklong cooking seminar at the home of an old friend, who has opened a tourist culinary school. The couple&#x2019;s first night is in Rome, where they meet a charismatic travel writer, Freddy, who, unfortunately, is killed before their eyes. Once they are ensconced in the cooking school, it becomes apparent that the reasons for Freddy&#x2019;s murder haven&#x2019;t stayed in Rome and that any one of the other school attendees could have had a hand in the malevolent events. Although there is certainly a mystery here, it gets lost, perhaps happily so, in the book&#x2019;s lush surroundings as well as in the flavors of the wine, pasta, and panna cotta that will have readers heading for their nearest Italian restaurant&#x2014;not that it can compare. Perhaps the recipes at the book&#x2019;s conclusion will help.

{"asin": "0062066390", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Best-Selling Author Brad Thor ReviewsOutlaw PlatoonHow close can we get to really knowing what it's like to succeed in combat? To fight, to survive&mdash;even thrive&mdash;while facing enemy fire every other day? To get on-the-job training in what it takes to be a strong, decisive commander? These are a few of the things that makeOutlaw Platoonby Sean Parnell and John Bruning such a kick-ass read.Two of the grittiest, most intense tales of courage and camaraderie under fire that I own are BlackHawk DownandLone Survivor. Now I have a third:Outlaw Platoon. It&rsquo;s theBlack Hawk Downfor the 21st Century. It is an absolutely gripping, edge-of-your-seat ride that follows these men when the fates foolishly attempt to stack the deck against them. This book has Hollywood blockbuster written all over it. But there&rsquo;s much more than just the guns-blazing action. It is an epic tale of leadership, heroism, and the bond among warriors who ply their deadly trade with a deceivingly simple mandate&mdash;to kill the enemy and return home together alive. It&rsquo;s an absolute must read!Brad Thor Interviews Sean ParnellBrad Thor:What was your first day like on the ground in Afghanistan&rsquo;s eastern frontier?Sean Parnell:The moment I arrived at Forward Operating Base Bermel, the insurgents attacked the base with rocket fire. They missed the FOB, but hit a local village, killing and wounding a number of children. The villagers rushed their injured to our front gate, and I ran to help. Our troops wanted to help all of the children, but the Afghan fathers insisted the boys be treated first. I grabbed a little girl anyways and sprinted for the aid station. She bled out in my arms as I ran.That was my introduction to combat. All I was, all I had been, changed in that instant.Thor:What surprised you about the enemy in Afghanistan?Parnell:We found an enemy that wasn&rsquo;t a bunch of farmers with leftover weapons, but one of the finest light infantry forces in the world. These fighters were brilliantly led, seasoned warriors. Some had spent their entire lives in combat&mdash;stretching back to the Soviet War in the 1980&rsquo;s. They were elusive, heavily armed and extremely well equipped with the latest armor-piercing bullets, anti-tank weapons, body armor, and other gear essential to ground operations.They also had no mercy. None. Their objective was to overrun an American platoon, behead everyone and stick our heads on stakes. In battle, we heard them on the radio ordering their teams to do this, and we saw the huge knives they carried for the task.They did their best to overrun us three times. But we were better. Just barely.Thor:Describe the bond forged in battle&mdash;the loyalty and bravery you saw and why you think that&rsquo;s vital to success.Parnell:During my 16 months in combat I saw the noblest aspects of the human spirit, thanks to the bond that developed among the men. We realized that the only way we could survive this crucible was to remain committed to each other. Not for ourselves, but to ensure that we would survive to see our loved ones back home again.Thor:How would you describe the men in your platoon?Parnell:In a word: unique. Our army mirrors the country it&rsquo;s sworn to protect, and I think the Outlaws reflected America&rsquo;s greatest strength: diversity. My men came from all walks of life. They believed in American exceptionalism with every fiber of their being.

The final book in Cass's \"Selection\" series begins in the midst of a rebel attack on the palace. The heroine, America, is one of four remaining ladies competing in the selection process in this dystopian saga. Through bravery and a strong character, America has won the people's hearts. However, the king continues doing everything in his power to undermine her opportunities to succeed. While the contestants are competing for Maxon's heart, many other events from the outside world transpire: America's father dies and leaves her a letter, she is shot visiting rebels outside the city, the relationship between Aspen and America shifts, and the Southern rebels begin attacking people in the castles. All the while, the protagonist continues to fall deeply in love with Maxon even though he is involved with her competition. Fans of this series will not be disappointed by the ending.

The sheets were stained with blood, and Mara was nowhere to be seen. Dallying with his father&#x2019;s latest bride-to-be on the night before her wedding is scandalous enough, but the possibility that he may have murdered her as well makes Temple a social outcast. Now the &#x201C;Killer&#x201D; Duke of Lamont, Temple has built a new life for himself as the part-owner and muscle behind London&#x2019;s most notorious gambling hell, the Fallen Angel. When Temple hears footsteps following him home late one night, the last person he expects to see when he turns around is a dead woman. Mara ruined his life, but now she offers Temple the redemption he desperately craves, if he will only meet her demands. In the third stunning installment of her Rule of Scoundrels series, RITA Award&#x2013;winning MacLean richly rewards readers with a dark, intense, and supremely sexy story that will connect emotionally on every level.

Now, inFound, she digs even deeper and explores the tough issues that resonate in most women&#8217;s lives.

With candor and grace, Tatum chronicles the challenges and joys of being a single mother to three grown children, an ex-wife, a working actress, and a woman who has lived her life in the public eye for the better part of forty-five years. She speaks frankly about the persistence it took to beat her addictions to drugs and alcohol, and the hard work of staying clean and sober, including dealing with the deep emotional void that illicit substances falsely promise to fill.Tatum details her ongoing efforts to negotiate friends, family, aging, money, love, loss, and Hollywood, while the specter of her past continues to lurk, a reminder of her battle and a testament to her will to survive.

{"asin": "0062059211", "description": "Yorinks, author of the Caldecott-winning Hey, Al , and veteran Mad magazine illustrator Drucker (who here makes his children's book debut) are just the right fellas to relate this rollicking tale set in the Wild West. The book opens with three mighty tall (the type is 214 high) words: \"WHO'S WHITEFISH WILL?\" The answer, set in ordinary-size type: \"Why, he's just about the best danged sheriff that ever lived. That's who.\" That pretty much sets the tone for the folksy-tongued narrator's tale, which uncoils as smoothly as a rodeo rope. Sure-firing Will has proven \"so good at rassling rustlers that soon there were no more rustlers left to rassle.\" So he is put out to pasture, left to raise roosters and blow on his harmonica (his \"stinkweed serenades\" sound \"worse than a bobcat caught on a cactus\"). But what happens when bad Bart (who was \"so mean rattlesnakes would line up and try to kiss his feet\") and his gang ride into town and threaten to burn the place down? The townsfolk go fetch Will, of course, who runs the varmint out of town--by playing his harmonica (\" ' Ay yi yi yi yi! ' Bart cried, 'Have mercy!' \"). And the West is safe for honest (earplug-wearing) folks once again. Drucker's droll, hyperbolic art--featuring a passel of comical cowboy caricatures--is smack on target.

To fight, to survive&mdash;even thrive&mdash;while facing enemy fire every other day? To get on-the-job training in what it takes to be a strong, decisive commander? These are a few of the things that makeOutlaw Platoonby Sean Parnell and John Bruning such a kick-ass read.Two of the grittiest, most intense tales of courage and camaraderie under fire that I own are BlackHawk DownandLone Survivor. Now I have a third:Outlaw Platoon. It&rsquo;s theBlack Hawk Downfor the 21st Century. It is an absolutely gripping, edge-of-your-seat ride that follows these men when the fates foolishly attempt to stack the deck against them. This book has Hollywood blockbuster written all over it. But there&rsquo;s much more than just the guns-blazing action. It is an epic tale of leadership, heroism, and the bond among warriors who ply their deadly trade with a deceivingly simple mandate&mdash;to kill the enemy and return home together alive. It&rsquo;s an absolute must read!Brad Thor Interviews Sean ParnellBrad Thor:What was your first day like on the ground in Afghanistan&rsquo;s eastern frontier?Sean Parnell:The moment I arrived at Forward Operating Base Bermel, the insurgents attacked the base with rocket fire. They missed the FOB, but hit a local village, killing and wounding a number of children. The villagers rushed their injured to our front gate, and I ran to help. Our troops wanted to help all of the children, but the Afghan fathers insisted the boys be treated first. I grabbed a little girl anyways and sprinted for the aid station. She bled out in my arms as I ran.That was my introduction to combat. All I was, all I had been, changed in that instant.Thor:What surprised you about the enemy in Afghanistan?Parnell:We found an enemy that wasn&rsquo;t a bunch of farmers with leftover weapons, but one of the finest light infantry forces in the world. These fighters were brilliantly led, seasoned warriors. Some had spent their entire lives in combat&mdash;stretching back to the Soviet War in the 1980&rsquo;s. They were elusive, heavily armed and extremely well equipped with the latest armor-piercing bullets, anti-tank weapons, body armor, and other gear essential to ground operations.They also had no mercy. None. Their objective was to overrun an American platoon, behead everyone and stick our heads on stakes. In battle, we heard them on the radio ordering their teams to do this, and we saw the huge knives they carried for the task.They did their best to overrun us three times. But we were better. Just barely.Thor:Describe the bond forged in battle&mdash;the loyalty and bravery you saw and why you think that&rsquo;s vital to success.Parnell:During my 16 months in combat I saw the noblest aspects of the human spirit, thanks to the bond that developed among the men. We realized that the only way we could survive this crucible was to remain committed to each other. Not for ourselves, but to ensure that we would survive to see our loved ones back home again.Thor:How would you describe the men in your platoon?Parnell:In a word: unique. Our army mirrors the country it&rsquo;s sworn to protect, and I think the Outlaws reflected America&rsquo;s greatest strength: diversity. My men came from all walks of life. They believed in American exceptionalism with every fiber of their being.

They inspired the highly imaginative child who loved make-believe to craft one of the most enduring characters in television history, an achievement that would earn her a record twenty-one Emmy nominations&mdash;the most for an actor in the award's history&mdash;and the crown as \"Leading Lady of Daytime.\"When Lucci andAll My Childrenwere introduced to the world in 1971, American television changed forever. Susan's character, the beautiful, spirited, and mercurial Erica Kane, was an original&mdash;the first vixen viewers loved to hate. But while millions have enjoyed getting to know Erica's many sides&mdash;and have been awed at how this character has continually remade herself&mdash;the woman who plays her has remained a mystery.In her long-awaited memoir, this very private actress, wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, friend, and entrepreneur pulls back the curtain to reveal her story.Susan, like Erica Kane, has undergone a metamorphosis many times.All My Lifeshares the stories of those transformations: starring in roles on television and stage, where she took Broadway not just by storm but \"by tsunami\" as one critic raved about her performance inAnnie Get Your Gun; mounting successful cabaret acts (solo and with Regis Philbin); bringing art and joy back to New York in the wake of 9/11; conquering the tango with Tony Dovolani on ABC's hit showDancing with the Stars; and building a successful career as an entrepreneur with a signature line of products.Susan goes beyond her success to talk about the darker moments, too, including the childhood guilt she harbored over the death of her dear grandmother, the car accident that nearly took away her career and her eyesight, her newborn son's life-threatening illness, coping with her husband's cancer, and the pain of miscarriage&mdash;one of the many parallels between her Erica Kane.As charming, down-to-earth, and compelling as the woman whose story it tells,All My Lifeshines a spotlight on one of our most popular stars and reminds us of the power of dreams and how we can find the courage and tenacity to make them come true.A Look InsideAll My LifeClick on the images below to open larger versions.Here I amat eleven months old.Of course, my greatest blessingshave been family and friends.

She just got out of juvie for pilfering items from the rich, mean girls at Valley Prep High School, where she earned the nickname Sly Fox. That story was told in Pretty Crooked (HarperCollins, 2012), and this novel refers back to those events. As the story opens, instead of getting ready for her first day back at school, Willa is standing in the middle of her ransacked house looking for some trace of her artist mom. A cryptic email and a stash of cash are all she has to get her started. Along with her hunky friend Aidan, who has his own shady past; Tre, who is trying hard to walk the straight and narrow; and Cherise, who has become her ex-best friend, Willa determines to find out what has happened to her mother. She tries to follow her trail, but along the way loses the money, fights with Aidan, and runs into the seriously bad guys who are chasing her mom. Willa is a strong but impulsive character, more than willing to jump into the middle of the action before thinking through the consequences. The story moves quickly, with barely a break for readers to catch their breath. Fans of Ally Carter's \"Heist Society\" series (Hyperion) will enjoy this book.

So when Melinda Wentworth asks Henrietta to discern the real reason for James Glossup&#x2019;s proposal, Henrietta investigates and learns that he must marry within a month or risk losing an inheritance from his great-aunt. She reluctantly informs Melinda of her &#xAD;fianc&#xE9;&#x2019;s true matrimonial motive, and then feels more than a few twinges of guilt when Melinda breaks off the engagement. So, vowing to find the right woman for James to wed, she marshals all of her social connections, but the more time she spends with James, the more convinced Henrietta becomes that she herself is that woman. With 50 historical romances to her credit, RITA Award&#x2013;winning and best-selling Laurens is an expert crafter of irresistible love stories.

Newly ensconced in a tony Arizona neighborhood and enrolled at an exclusive prep school, the teen begins to learn how the other half lives. Willa&#x2019;s joy, though, is tempered when she learns her new top-of-the-heap friends are cyberbullies who viciously taunt the school&#x2019;s Hispanic scholarship students. In an effort to seek justice, Willa takes to a life of petty crime, stealing from rich students to give to those poorer. Ludwig wisely allows room for Willa&#x2019;s doubts about her newfound pursuit, while convincingly dealing with the ways bullies can wield power over even those who question their actions. Meanwhile, a subplot involving Willa&#x2019;s mother hints that the artist isn&#x2019;t who she seems to be.

The  blend of story, characters, action, mystery, and humor worked really well. The combination of Eliza Braun's tough, opinionated exterior and her soft interior with Wellington Books' bookish, somewhat fumbling exterior and his hidden depths is a wonderful dynamic.(Top Pick)-Night Owl ReviewsMorris and Ballantine just get better and better with Eliza and Welly, and I have difficulty thinking of anything I didn't like about the characters or the world in which these authors set the story. I have  readTHE JANUS AFFAIRseveral times now and I am delighted every time. Describing a novel as delightful might sound trite  but there isn't a better word to describe a book that keeps your interest and makes you laugh each time you read it.-Book Chick CityI felt The Janus Affair was tailored expertly and tightly woven, not  unlike an elegant leather corset with a strong foundation and bright bits and bobs of clockwork brilliance that leaves the reader wrapped securely and held delighted beneath each thread. Highly, highly recommended.-Lit StackThe Janus Affair isn't pretentious or overwrought. It seeks nothing but to entertain readers in the smartest and best way possible and to show the love that Ballantine and Morris have for steampunk, for larger-than-life adventurers and big stories. It's engaging, it's a page  turner and above all, it's a really fun story to get lost in for a while.-Sticky Trigger EntertainmentIf you've never read steampunk before, this would be a great introduction. If you've felt steampunk wasn't for you, The Janus Affair&#xA0;will change your mind.

{"asin": "0062069934", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Margolin kicks off his latest thriller with a bit of literary legerdemain. He introduces Charles Benedict, a strikingly handsome and charismatic defense attorney and amateur magician who appears to be the novel's leading man. But Benedict is swiftly exposed as an extremely effective homicidal sociopath, and the book shifts to its true protagonist, private sleuth Dana Cutler, who is quickly dispatched on a convoluted cross-country search for a bejeweled golden scepter with a history curiously similar to that of Sam Spade's famous Maltese Falcon. It's a given that this quest will eventually bring the shrewd detective in contact with the homicidal Benedict. Jonathan Davis's narration is smooth and well paced. He adds just the right amount of smarm and smirk to Benedict's speech and captures all of Dana's drive, determination, and fearlessness. The book's other characters have more than their share of accents&mdash;from the mysterious Frenchwoman who sends Dana after the scepter to a surprisingly cheery Russian mob boss. Davis ably handles these and others in a stylish performance with just an appropriate hint of sardonic amusement. A Harper hardcover.

An almost wordless fantasy about a young family consisting of a mom, her two daughters, and an assortment of animals who get evicted from their farmhouse on Christmas Eve. In a parallel to the original Christmas story and the small family that had nowhere to go, this odd group makes the best of a bad situation and takes up residence in an empty barn nearby. With good humor and determination, they march down the snowy path to the barn. The horses pull the grand piano (its flaming candelabra still lit) on skis, the dogs pull the bed (stuffed animals still arranged on it), and everyone gallops back for more. Everything goes: even the Santa and sleigh display from the yard, the decorated tree, and a toboggan carrying everything else, from the animals' food to the dryer (with the clothes still tumbling). And it's all moved in and set up, as the snow begins to fall, in plenty of time to celebrate the holiday. The beautiful oil paintings capture the cold, snow-swept, star-filled countryside as effectively as they portray the essence and personality of each character, human or animal. With Day's characteristic comic touches, realistic scenes are given a whimsical, at times almost absurd spin, and a jolly good time is had by all.Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Christmas We Moved to the Barn", "price": 7.79, "salesRank": {"Books": 1466510}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61SKSZ2P1HL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062051512", "0811835375"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0374311021"]}}
{"asin": "0062069039", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* Born the same year as Ralph Stanley and growing up very similarly on a hardscrabble Appalachian farm, Charlie Louvin gained fame in a brother act, too. Like the Stanleys, Charlie (1927&#x2013;2011) and Ira (1924&#x2013;65) Louvin made songs their mother taught them cornerstones of their repertoire. The songwriting elder brother in each pair drove it to eventual success, until Ira&#x2019;s alcoholism broke up their act, leaving the sober sibling to carry on, to greater fortune. It would be false, however, to say that Charlie achieved greater repute on his own, for he and Ira had set the gold standard for harmony singing in country music. They did it by ear and intuition, Charlie reveals, freely exchanging melodic and harmonic lines in the same song, though Ira invariably sang the highest notes. Louvin concentrates on his and Ira&#x2019;s relationship in this book, completed just two months before his death.

Ella Thomas, an 18-year-old jazz singer, is recruited for a dangerous and mind-boggling job, to go inside the Demi-Monde, an elaborate computer program designed to train combat soldiers, and bring out the daughter of the president of the U.S., who has become stranded inside it. Like Philip Jose Farmer&#x2019;s classic Riverworld series, the novel features an assortment of historical characters from various eras (its primary villains are the Nazi Reinhard Heydrich and black magician Aleister Crowley), and the Demi-Monde, a computer-construct with its own geographical, political, religious, and social structure, may remind some readers of the film The Matrix. Despite similarities to genre classics, the book stands on its own two feet. It&#x2019;s elegantly constructed, skillfully written, and absolutely impossible to stop reading. It ends on a beauty of a cliffhanger, too, pretty much guaranteeing that readers will be biting their nails until the sequel appears. --David Pitt", "title": "The Demi-Monde: Winter: A Novel (The Demi-Monde Saga)", "price": 11.04, "salesRank": {"Books": 1650509}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3sx1GkUL.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0062070371", "1849165068", "1849165025", "1849165076", "1849165106", "0062210815", "0143125427", "0307887448"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062070371", "1849165068", "1849165025"]}}

{"asin": "0062065351", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Release stuck stress with MELTOver a decade ago, Sue Hitzmann was at the height of her career as an international fitness presenter and instructor. She appeared to be in perfect health, yet she was experiencing debilitating pain in her foot. With a master&#39;s degree in exercise science and advanced training in neuromuscular therapy, she thought it would be easy to find out what was going on in her body, but even the most prominent doctors and physical therapists couldn&#39;t explain what was wrong. Although she was only in her twenties, Hitzmann&#39;s career was threatened and her quality of life was in decline.Hitzmann learned the hard way that diet, exercise, and muscular strength are not the foundation of a healthy, pain-free body. As she sought the true source of her pain, she radically changed her focus from fitness to hands-on bodywork.In her quest to live an active, pain-free life, she became fascinated by the emerging science of connective tissue, or fascia, which surrounds all aspects of your body, including your muscles, bones, nerves, and organs. The researchers she met were discovering that connective tissue&#8212;the system of the body that supports, protects, and stabilizes&#8212;was responsive, adaptable, and renewable. What Hitzmann came to realize is that connective tissue dehydration is the underlying cause of the daily aches, stiffness, and strain that leads to pain, as well as weight gain, sleep problems, and many other seemingly unrelated issues. Through her personal exploration and private practice, she developed the MELT Method.MELT can help you fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly, have more energy during the day, improve your posture, reduce stress and tension, shed excess body fat, and reduce cellulite.While it may seem too good to be true, it&#39;s worked for more than 50,000 people. And now it can work for you. Live your best, most youthful and vibrant life possible.

As the young cats in Gray Wing&#x2019;s group journey through varied terrain, much of the action involves seeking prey, being prey, and encountering other felines who may or may not be friendly. Tension also builds around rivalries for mates. People&#x2014;referred to collectively as Twolegs&#x2014;do make occasional appearances, but they are of very little import.

Miranda had marched over to Neville&#x2019;s home intent on pulling her younger brother Roderick out of a den of iniquity only to discover that instead of gambling with London&#x2019;s most infamous gambling king, Roderick is the newest member of Neville&#x2019;s Philanthropy Guild: a select group of nobleman who use their business skills and wealth to support various charitable endeavors. Although Miranda is delighted to discover that the notorious  sinner Neville has a saintly side, it doesn&#x2019;t mean she can afford to associate with him. Miranda&#x2019;s aunts have drummed it into her that one step off the path of respectability will ruin her life forever. But after one kiss from Neville, Miranda is no longer certain that a respectable life is all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be.

{"asin": "0062049801", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2011: InState of Wonder, pharmaceutical researcher Dr. Marina Singh sets off into the Amazon jungle to find the remains and effects of a colleague who recently died under somewhat mysterious circumstances. But first she must locate Dr. Anneck Swenson, a renowned gynecologist who has spent years looking at the reproductive habits of a local tribe where women can conceive well into their middle ages and beyond. Eccentric and notoriously tough, Swenson is paid to find the key to this longstanding childbearing ability by the same company for which Dr. Singh works. Yet that isn&#x2019;t their only connection: both have an overlapping professional past that Dr. Singh has long tried to forget. In finding her former mentor, Dr. Singh must face her own disappointments and regrets, along with the jungle&#x2019;s unforgiving humidity and insects, makingState of Wondera multi-layered atmospheric novel that is hard to put down. Indeed, Patchett solidifies her well-deserved place as one of today&#x2019;s master storytellers. Emotional, vivid, and a work of literature that will surely resonate with readers in the weeks and months to come,State of Wondertruly is a thing of beauty and mystery, much like the Amazon jungle itself.--Jessica ScheinAmazon Exclusive: Elizabeth Gilbert Interviews Ann PatchettElizabeth Gilbertis the author of the #1New York Timesbestseller,Eat, Pray, Love, as well as the short story collectionPilgrims&mdash;a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award, and winner of the 1999 John C. Zacharis First Book Award from Ploughshares. A Pushcart Prize winner and National Magazine Award-nominated journalist, she works as writer-at-large for GQ.Elizabeth Gilbert:As your close personal friend, I happen to know that you traveled to the Amazon to conduct research for this novel, and that you sort of hated the Amazon--can you share a little about that?Ann Patchett:I absolutely loved the Amazon for four days.  It was gorgeous and unfamiliar and deeply fascinating.  Unfortunately, I stayed there for ten days.  There are a lot of insects in the Amazon, a lot of mud, surprisingly few vegetables, too many snakes.  You can&rsquo;t go anywhere by yourself, which makes sense if you don&rsquo;t know the terrain, but I enjoy going places by myself.  I can see how great it would be for a very short visit, and how great it would be if you lived there and had figured out what was and wasn&rsquo;t going to kill you, but the interim length of time isn&rsquo;t great.EG:Didn't I hear that you have a sort of magical story about a friend who is also a writer, who was also once going to write a book about the Amazon? Can you share this miraculous tale? Also, is your writer friend pretty?AP:This friend of mine, who happens to be you, is gorgeous, and much taller in real life.  Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie.   I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&rsquo;t worked out with you it came to me.   If this is true I think your name should be on the cover.  It would increase sales significantly.EG:Readers of your prior work--particularly the luminousBel Canto--will be delighted to see that opera makes an appearance in this novel, as well. In fact, one of the most dramatic scenes in the book takes place at the opera. Is that a wink and a nod to loyal readers, or just an expression of your own deep and abiding musical passions?AP:It&rsquo;s a wink and a nod to Werner Herzog and his brilliant Amazon film &ldquo;Fitzcarraldo&rdquo; which opens at the opera house in Manaus where the aforementioned scene takes place.  I had very little experience with opera when I wroteBel Canto, and since then it&rsquo;s become a huge part of my life.  It was fun to write a scene set at the opera now that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.EG:State of Wondera rollicking adventure story, full of peril and bravery and death-defying action. I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?AP:Ah, the life of the mind.  All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen.  I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds.  If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this.  I also love to write a strong plot.  I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled.  I always think about Raymond Chandler.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m getting the phrasing wrong but the general idea is that when things get slow, bring in a man with a gun.  If you can&rsquo;t find a gun, a poison arrow works just as well.EG:The cover is a work of beauty. Authors are not always so lucky. Tell us how you managed such a miracle?AP:When I first started writing this book, I came downstairs one night and found my husband listening to &ldquo;Horowitz at Carnegie Hall&rdquo;.  The album cover has a very lush filigreed border.  I had two thoughts: first, I have an amazing husband who thankfully held onto his Horowitz LPs; second, that the album cover had the exact the feeling I wanted for my book--half jungle, half Baroque period.  When I was finished writing the novel I sent the album to my editor, who sent it to the art department.

{"asin": "0062064398", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "When we last saw Jennifer Johnson (in Jennifer Johnson Is Sick of Being Single), she was dubiously embracing her happily-ever-after with department-store-heir Brad Keller. Well, married life is as bad as she feared: her honeymoon is a gastrointestinal disaster, and her mother-in-law buys (and decorates) the mansion next door for the newlyweds. Brad is determined to become the next president of Keller&#x2019;s, and Jennifer is desperate to be the trophy wife who makes that happen for him. Unfortunately, she is not the trophy-wife type, and as she spoils investor dinners and runs up astronomical credit-card bills, she and Brad grow even farther apart&#x2014;although were they ever very close to begin with? This feels more subversive than the usual chick lit, despite the familiar trappings. The sharp, funny writing masks a dark skewering of a megachurch, Real Housewives, and mass-consuming luxury culture. Readers who missed book one might have trouble sympathizing with Jennifer, especially as she chases the sexy Stepford ideal. Fortunately, McElhatton crafts an explosive ending, where, finally, after two books, cosmic justice prevails. --Susan Maguire", "title": "Jennifer Johnson Is Sick of Being Married: A Novel", "price": 8.89, "salesRank": {"Books": 1138380}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-eQ8WSJDL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003H4RD5Q", "B005B1JXG0", "0061133221", "0385342039", "1451609825", "1401324541"], "bought_together": ["B003H4RD5Q", "B005B1JXG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005B1JXG0", "B003H4RD5Q", "0061133221"]}}

He finds himself on the run with a small group of his peers, battling other supernatural beings in a race to find a powerful artifact and avert disaster. Hmm, sounds familiar. This is not The Lightning Thief (Hyperion, 2005) and the mythology is the lost city of Atlantis rather than the Greek pantheon, but comparisons with the \"Percy Jackson\" series are inevitable. Unfortunately, this volume hardly measures up. Jack McKinley is just not as likable or believable as Rick Riordan's protagonist, and the supporting characters are flat. There are far too many deus ex machina moments needed to move the story along (e.g., Marco falling to his death but landing just close enough to a magic waterfall to not actually die). There is plenty of action throughout, and some of it is quite original (nearly dying under a mountain of flaming bat guano is certainly \"fresh\"), but it is not enough to make up for the uneven plot and weak characters.-Anthony C.

After the funeral, his dad's home office is burglarized yet nothing appears to be missing. Em is whisked off to France by a family friend and his daughter, lovely and intimidating Charlotte, and the teens spot a stranger with a gun stalking them through the streets of Paris. Finally, when Em returns home, he is shocked to learn that his mother has been committed to a psychiatric facility and when he goes to visit her, she slurs a warning in her drugged state: run. Now Em cannot seem to find a safe place to hide from an omniscient group of pursuers. He connects with Victor, an oddly helpful vagrant who turns out to be a government secret service officer. Victor, Charlotte, and Em plot, scheme, and uncover clues left by the deceased professor, which leads them down a path of intrigue complete with international travel, deadly epidemics, and large-scale conspiracies. Brennan serves up a fun read with guy appeal, a Dan Brown-like thriller about Nostradamus, meandering into an international environmental statement, with betrayals and lies so pervasive that it's hard to decipher the actual truth.

On the opposite coast, Dodger is a confused boy who gets radio messages from the past in his head. Both kids win an \"alien detection\" fellowship and travel with their families to conduct field research and do deeper investigation into extraterrestrials. When it turns out that their projects point to an actual alien invasion, the two finally meet and join forces. Intriguing brief interludes describe another girl who is trapped in an endlessly repeating day, which is also part of the aliens' secret scheme. Details of the aliens' malicious mission emerge carefully and sometimes subtly, drawing readers in. Dates and times are given at the beginning of each chapter, but the year is withheld, a clever touch as it lets readers realize that the repeated day sections actually take place in the past. The pacing slows at times, especially in Haley's opening section, which takes up the first third of the novel. The abrupt shift to Dodger's story stalls momentum for a bit, but the action accelerates as he discovers he has amazing powers and finally unites with Haley. There's more to both protagonists than their alien-hunter roles. Dodger feels like an outcast from his family and Haley has ambitious career goals. However, ultimately neither one resonates as a truly memorable figure, and the supporting characters are generally two-dimensional. Still, the premise is engaging, and final revelations about the invasion are mostly satisfying and surprising.-Steven Engelfried, Wilsonville Public Library, OR&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

{"asin": "0062071041", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Robison Wells Interviews His Brother, Dan WellsDan Wells is the acclaimed author of the John Cleaver series:I Am Not a Serial Killer,Mr. Monster, andI Don&rsquo;t Want to Kill You. He has been nominated for both the Hugo and the Campbell Award and has won two Parsec Awards for his podcastWriting Excuses. Robison Wells, Dan&rsquo;s younger brother, is the author ofVariant, whichPublishers Weeklycalled &ldquo;a chilling, masterful debut&rdquo; in a starred review, and its sequel,Feedback(available Fall 2012). Here, Robison interviews his brother aboutPartials, Dan&rsquo;s pulse-pounding first book in his post-apocalyptic series that questions the very concept of what it means to be human.Robison:Dan is my brother, exactly 13 months older than me. He and I shared a room our entire childhood, took the same classes, even dated the same girls. Dan got me into writing about twelve years ago, and ever since we&rsquo;ve critiqued each other&rsquo;s work, brainstormed new ideas, and told each other how terrible he is. So, with such a long background together, I&rsquo;m particularly interested to see if I can learn anything new in this interview.I&rsquo;ve read so much of your writing over the years, from your poem about turkeys in the fifth grade to your first epic fantasy to your literary farce to your horror, and now your YA post-apocalyptic Partials. Is there anything you&rsquo;ve written that I&rsquo;d be surprised to hear about?Dan:I wrote someRiftsfan fiction in high school&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if you knew about that. I actually reused a part of it forPartials.Robison:What part?Dan:I won&rsquo;t say, but it&rsquo;s in the first third.Robison:You&rsquo;ve written in all these different genres: Is it because you&rsquo;re still looking for the perfect fit? Or are you just interested in writing lots of different things?Dan:Almost every book I write is a new genre, or a weird combination of genres, because I like to branch out and try new things. I never would have imagined that I&rsquo;d write a horror series, but that was the first book I published. I never would have found that character, or the audience that loves him, if I&rsquo;d forced myself to stick to one thing.Robison:How was the transition from supernatural to sci-fi?Dan:Not too bad, since I see them as very connected&mdash;the only real difference between fantasy and SF is the explanation of where the weird stuff comes from. SF ended up being a lot harder, in some ways, because I had to make those explanations scientifically sound. In my horror series I could just say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo; With SF I had to do a ton of research into genetics, biology, and the science of decay.Robison:How did you do your research?Dan:A lot of my research started online, including Wikipedia&mdash;people make fun of it as a research tool, and I admit that it&rsquo;s a terrible place to end your research, but it&rsquo;s a fantastic place to start. From there I found more detailed websites, and eventually some great connections to books. One of the most useful books I read wasThe World Without Usby Alan Weisman, about what would happen to the things we leave behind if we suddenly weren&rsquo;t there to take care of them. It&rsquo;s a very detailed combination of scientific research and thought experiment.InPartials, the apocalypse wasn&rsquo;t a bomb or a war or anything physically destructive, just a disease: We died, but all our stuff is still just sitting there. It was a fun situation to study, and a blast to depict in a book.Robison:So, having done all that research, what tips would you give for surviving an apocalyptic pandemic? Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re immune to the virus.Dan:I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re going to work that out, but there you go. Once you have that taken care of, you live in a combination of paradise and medieval squalor. You will have no electricity or running water, but almost everything else will be free. Canned food can last for a decade or more before going bad, so you can live at a subsistence level just by scavenging the local stores.Robison:Why do you think your society of survivors ended up being organized and civil and less Mad Max-ish?Dan:A big part of it is the scarcity issue. Mad Max and similar apocalyptic scenarios start with the premise that everything is destroyed. The survivors have to fight tooth and nail for what little resources are left. InPartials, everything you could ever want is just there for the taking.Robison:What books/movies/music/TV influencedPartials?Dan:Some of the influences are obvious, likeBattlestar GalacticaandChildren of Men. Others are harder to spot. I listened to a steady diet of protest songs and revolutionary music while writing, stuff like &ldquo;Uprising&rdquo; by Muse, because they got my blood going and helped me get into the main character&rsquo;s fiery personality. And some of my influences didn&rsquo;t really end up in the book, though I still count them&mdash;things likeMad MaxandA Canticle for Leibowitzthat inspired my love of post-apocalyptic stories, but which didn&rsquo;t really apply in this case.The biggest influence may have been our own history and current events.Partialsis, at times, a very angry book, and that&rsquo;s a reflection of my own feelings about a lot of the stuff I see going on in the world.Robison:Let&rsquo;s talk about that. You&rsquo;ve said before that you think one of the reasons dystopia is so popular right now is because our world is becoming more dystopian. What current events influenced you inPartials?Dan:For example, the story is set eleven years after a devastating catastrophe&mdash;and in 2012, my readers are also eleven years after their own devastating catastrophe. The events of 9/11 changed the way we do almost everything in this country, and to a lesser extent the rest of the world. One of the things I tried to do in the book was show that the adults, who remember what life was like before the end of the world, have a very different attitude about it than the kids who&rsquo;ve never really known any other life.I also tried to throw in a lot of the extreme measures our government and our culture in general have taken in response to terrorism&mdash;reduced privacy, indefinite detention, torture, and so on. I think there are arguments on both sides of all these issues, and I tried to give each side a fair shake. Kira, the main character, has very strong ideas about what&rsquo;s justifiable and what&rsquo;s not, and just because she&rsquo;s the main character doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s always right. If anyone&rsquo;s actually &ldquo;right&rdquo; at all.Robison:So, on a happier note, why do you think I&rsquo;m so awesome?Dan:Because you take after your brother.", "title": "Partials (The Partials Sequence)", "price": 6.65, "salesRank": {"Books": 453474}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51y8Rm9v7lL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062071076", "0062071106", "006207203X", "0765329581", "076532959X", "0312650094", "0312650086", "B00BR0SILU", "0765329603", "0062072064", "0312569033", "B00BCUP0ES", "0385742371", "039925675X", "0062072099", "1423157370", "1250024633", "0062085484", "0062105450", "0399256776", "0062217100", "0547959206", "1423176375", "0062112430", "1933718552", "0062105485", "0316134023", "1442430001", "1933718757", "0399162410", "1442421762", "0062085573", "0312641893", "0062085530", "0547959214", "0399167838", "0399256768", "0761463275", "1423157516", "0062327968", "0062217070", "1423157311", "0062059998", "0765331705", "0062059939", "0062014552", "0312642962", "0547959109", "1416912045", "0805094598", "147781728X", "006197806X", "0062220004", "1595143998", "1599906953", "0312642970", "1423171020", "1606841750", "1595143971", "1250036429", "015206396X", "0385742886", "0062014536", "1442421797", "B00AF3T8B4", "0062117181", "B00CY39JEY", "0062059963", "0765329611", "B00CNKPEQ0", "B00CF5Q8BS", "0062072048", "0399162429", "0312551371", "0316133973", "1619630621", "1423157524", "006222560X", "0062345214", "0805094601", "1442430028", "0062026488", "1442445629", "0385742495", "031612611X", "0062085506", "039916667X", "1939100011", "0805097716", "0062117262", "0316197084", "1606841769", "1442423668", "1423170288", "006202406X", "1442409096", "0525423664", "1250005116", "0385737947", "1442445807"], "bought_together": ["0062071076", "0062071106"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062071084", "0062071106", "0385737955", "014241977X"]}}

Sound familiar? Evidently hoping that young readers might find it clever, Krosoczka takes this rather trite plotline and positively festoons it with standard cop TV show lines and tropes. It helps that the duo are platypuses, but this does not have the sense of fun found in Krosoczka&#x2019;s Lunch Lady series (soon to be a major motion picture) and is way more confusing.

{"asin": "0062067680", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist, music producer, and actor T.I. and his bestselling celebrity collaborator, David Ritz, continue the explosive story of Power and Beauty that began in the street-lit epicPower &#38; Beauty.When his mother, Charlotte, was killed, Paul &#8220;Power&#8221; Clay and his closest friend, Tanya &#8220;Beauty&#8221; Long, fell under the spell of a savvy and ruthless Atlanta businessman named Slim, who promised to protect them.Wise beyond her years, Beauty always knew that the only person she could rely on was herself. It didn&#8217;t take long for the levelheaded young woman to recognize the simmering violence beneath Slim&#8217;s street charm. But getting away from him wasn&#8217;t easy, and it came at a heartbreaking price: turning her back on Power. Escaping to the glamorous catwalks of the Big Apple, she&#8217;s worked her breathtaking good looks and quick wit to build a thriving fashion business. Despite her success, she&#8217;s still haunted by the pain of leaving Power behind. Money and new men cannot erase the memory of the true love she denied.To Power, Slim&#8217;s world held everything he thought he wanted: women, wealth, power, authority. He discovered too late that Slim Simmons isn&#8217;t just a businessman&#8212;he&#8217;s a ruthless killer who will turn on anyone he thinks is getting in his way. He is the monster who murdered Charlotte. Now, he controls the fate of her only son.But neither Slim nor Power count on Beauty. Like Slim, she is a master who will manipulate, seduce, and sacrifice to get what she wants.

She has spent the past 100 years in the Everneath, a world where immortals, called the Everliving, go to replenish their strength by feeding on the energy of humans. Nikki, anchored by the memory of her boyfriend Jack, miraculously survived the feed. Now she has six final months at home to say her good-byes before returning to the Tunnels, a hellish extension of the Everneath. Combining elements of the Persephone myth and the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, the story alternates between the events that led Nikki to agree to the feed and her return. As the only person ever to survive, she is urged by Cole, the Everliving who initially took her away, to seize control of the Everneath (with him, of course). Will she?

{"asin": "0062072188", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Exclusive: Daniel Silva on WritingPortrait of a Spywith a PencilWhile on book tour, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to find that readers are fascinated by how writers actually write. Most readers hold in their mind an idealized image of the novelist at work&mdash;a figure in a trendy urban coffeehouse, a solitary figure walking along an empty beach. The truth, however, is seldom so romantic.Before going any further, let us stipulate that, much like the hero of my novels, the art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon, I am something of a creature of habit. I work seven days a week, from early in the morning until six thirty in the evening, when I stop to watch the evening news. My work clothing never varies: gray sweatpants by Russell Athletic, a long-sleeve T-shirt by L.L. Bean, fleece Acorn moccasins, and discount cotton socks from Marks &amp; Spencer in England. Occasionally, visitors to our house will catch a glimpse of this outfit, but, for the most part, my wife and children tend to shield me from public view. As a rule, I don&rsquo;t answer the telephone&mdash;unless it is a family emergency of some sort&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t read e-mail. I nibble rather than eat.Portrait of a Spy, like all the Gabriel Allon novels, was fueled largely by McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits.I have a computer, of course, but I really do most of my actualwritingin longhand, on yellow legal pads. I prefer to work while lying on the floor rather than at my desk. This annoys my wife because she took a great deal of time and effort to have a desk custom made to fit my office. When I showed her a photograph of Muriel Spark, one of her literary heroes, writing in longhand stretched across a floor, she was only partially mollified. Sometimes we talk about living somewhere other than Georgetown. Secretly, the very idea terrifies me. After writing 14 books in the same room of the same house, I am afraid I have lost the ability to work anywhere else.As for my writing instrument of choice, it is unquestionably the pencil. There is something about the sound it makes scratching across the page that, for me, is the essence of composition. The pencil is the antithesis of all things cyber and e, a means of returning, however briefly, to a world that is unconnected and unwired. A pad and pencil do not freeze or crash. There are no viruses or error messages. If a thunderstorm knocks out the power, the words will still be there when the lights come on again. And then, there is the satisfying natural rhythm of the work itself&mdash;the turning of the completed page, the sharpening of the dulled point, the fortnightly disposal of the fluffy wooden shavings.Lately, I have been hoarding pencils. I&rsquo;m not sure precisely when it began; I suspect it had something to do with the death of the typewriter. An irrational fear gripped me, a fear that pencils were next. If the typewriter could go extinct, how could the lowly, environmentally hostile pencil possibly hope to survive in the brave new world? I now order my favorite brand&mdash;the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior No. 2&mdash;by the case. I am reasonably confident I now have enough pencils on hand to see me through the next several novels&mdash;though, if I happen to misplace a pencil, I will search the house thoroughly before removing a new one from its special drawer and sharpening it for the first time. To sharpen a virgin pencil is, in a sense, to commit an act of assisted suicide. It saddens me.I wish it were not so. I wish I could write on a computer while traveling on an airplane or sitting in a strange hotel room, but I cannot. I have become a prisoner of my office.

{"asin": "0062071130", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "After a six-month absence, teenager Nikki Beckett has returned home, although no one could possibly understand under what circumstances. She has spent the past 100 years in the Everneath, a world where immortals, called the Everliving, go to replenish their strength by feeding on the energy of humans. Nikki, anchored by the memory of her boyfriend Jack, miraculously survived the feed. Now she has six final months at home to say her good-byes before returning to the Tunnels, a hellish extension of the Everneath. Combining elements of the Persephone myth and the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, the story alternates between the events that led Nikki to agree to the feed and her return. As the only person ever to survive, she is urged by Cole, the Everliving who initially took her away, to seize control of the Everneath (with him, of course). Will she? This first volume of a planned trilogy covers familiar territory (angsty heroine, adoring boyfriend, delicious bad boy) yet offers a promising start.

{"asin": "0062068539", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "*Starred Review* When in doubt, seek out an expert. As a scientist, Philippa Marbury knows the value of consulting with an authority, so when Pippa needs a man skilled in the art of seduction, she tracks down England&#x2019;s most infamous rake: Mr. Cross. In two weeks, Pippa is scheduled to wed Lord Castleton, and she would like to learn more about what she can expect from her husband-to-be after the ceremony. Unfortunately for Pippa, Cross, part-owner of London&#x2019;s most exclusive gaming hall, not only is unwilling to share his legendary &#x201C;skills&#x201D; with Pippa; he also makes her promise him that she will not seek out similar advice from any other man. Of course, as a good scientist Pippa knows there is a time to play by the rules, and then there are times you just have to break them.

When the wildly unpopular Colonel Protheroe is found murdered in the vicar's study, it seems that everyone&mdash;his unhappy wife, his daughter, a visiting artist, an embittered poacher, the vicar&mdash;has a motive in a mystery that confounds the authorities, consumes the village and can only be untangled by observations and deductions of our heroine: the elderly gossip-cum-sleuth Miss Marple. Saxon's artful and enthusiastic portrayal of a host of characters&mdash;male and female, guilty and innocent, young and old&mdash;will delight Christie fans, mystery lovers and anyone lucky enough to listen.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin": "0062071165", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Gr 7 Up-The second entry in the trilogy, a modern interpretation of the Persephone myth, picks up two months after the heartbreaking ending of Everneath (HarperCollins, 2012). Nikki Beckett is determined to save her true love, who selflessly gave himself to the life-sucking Tunnels of the Everneath in her place. Unfortunately, rescuing Jack requires the assistance of Cole, the Everliving being who originally lured Nikki into the Everneath, fed on her emotional pain, and now wants to use her to usurp its queen. As wary allies, Nikki and Cole agree to face the perils of the labyrinthine landscape guarding the entrance to the Tunnels where Jack is slowly wasting away. While the complexities of this frightening realm are richly explored and the murky intentions of Cole create tension, it's the memories of first love blossoming between Nikki and Jack that act as a compass in the dangerous underworld that give the novel its emotional core. The breakneck plotting never falters and perfectly sets up the cliff-hanger ending and final twist.

She makes her way on foot from East Meadow, New York, to the company headquarters of ParaGen in Manhattan in search of a way to cure the RM virus that kills newborns and to stop the expiration of Partials at age 20. Kira allies herself with the last human in Manhattan, Afa, a mentally unstable IT Director from ParaGen who may be able to help her, along with Samm and Heron, the Partials who betrayed, then saved her, and know what she really is. She has to find a cure before the Partials and humans destroy one another. Only by being united will everyone be able to live in peace. They all travel on foot and horseback from Manhattan to Chicago and then Denver to find answers. They end up with even more questions after finding human survivors in Denver who have a cure for RM that allows them to have children, but the cure comes at a huge price. Kira discovers a secret about herself that forces her to make the ultimate sacrifice to save others. The cliff-hanger ending ensures that fans can look forward to more surprises in the next book in this exciting and thought-provoking series, but this one doesn't stand alone.-Sharon Rawlins, New Jersey State Library, Trenton&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2013.

{"asin": "0062071793", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "A Grammy Award&#x2013;winning singer, Benin-born Kidjo is celebrated for her deep appreciation of world cultures represented in her music and her abiding sense of justice. In a memoir as vivacious as she is, Kidjo recounts her journey from the western African nation to international stardom. She was thrust into the music business at the age of six, when her mother pushed her onstage to substitute for a sick performer. Kidjo&#x2019;s music was heavily influenced by Miriam Makeba and Aretha Franklin as well as a growing awareness of racial injustice in the U.S., South Africa, and her own country, then under a Communist regime. She fled to Paris rather than succumb to censorship and began an international career that brought her in contact with artists from James Brown to Harry Belafonte, from Carlos Santana to Alicia Keys. Kidjo writes beautifully of the spirituality of singing, the public giving of self to the audience, and the intimate opening of the self to the spirit.

It isn&#x2019;t enough that four years ago, Hugh&#x2019;s alcohol-induced actions nearly ripped Honoria&#x2019;s family apart. The resulting scandal also cost Sarah the chance to participate in what turned out to be the best husband-catching season in recent memory. However, nothing is going to ruin Honoria&#x2019;s wedding to the Earl of Chatteris, and if that means Sarah must paste a smile on her face while talking to fellow guest Hugh, so be it. Of course, that smile becomes much easier to maintain with each additional kiss Sarah finds herself suddenly sharing with this impossible man. The third sparkling book in her Smythe-Smith quartet is quintessential Quinn: witty, whimsical, and wonderfully romantic. --John Charles", "title": "The Sum of All Kisses (Smythe-Smith)", "price": 6.83, "salesRank": {"Books": 77381}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513%2Bo-O6XTL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062072900", "006149190X", "0061233005", "0062068547", "0062100297", "006211817X", "1455508349", "1250041600", "037377818X", "1476708223", "1451693486", "0425268888", "145168522X", "0380780755", "0062089099", "0061491896", "0380780747", "0380785625", "0062223895", "0345535871", "0061491888", "0062231146", "0451415337", "0380789337", "0425253953", "0062240196", "0062232541", "0380789353", "0380789345", "0345536061", "0060531231", "0515151386", "1455519324", "0062107380", "0380800810", "0062068660", "0060531258", "1402268726", "1402278667", "140226383X", "1402278632", "0373778457", "0380820854", "0451239717", "1250001390", "0060876107", "0380820846", "1941419089", "0380815583", "006053124X", "0062276220", "1455523372", "0062219251", "0380815575", "1941419054", "0992278937", "0380800829", "0062068539", "194141902X", "0062118110", "1402278691", "0062068520", "0060876115", "0425265676", "0451468015", "0440245303", "0992278953", "1455524018", "0062219278", "1420127152", "0425259269", "0515151319", "145169346X", "0062118196", "1420132245", "0062223879", "0062229907", "B009WI4Y3U", "125002935X", "1402278721", "0062240129", "0062276964", "1402268696", "0373777833", "0062068679", "0062317164", "0062231405", "0425264831", "1451685203", "006223885X", "0062229818", "0062033018", "0425259854", "0062267965", "145551330X", "0062068652", "1402278756", "125002384X", "140226979X", "006223126X"], "bought_together": ["0062072900", "006149190X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0062068660", "0380815575", "0061233005", "006149190X"]}}

{"asin": "0062073656", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "It hardly seems possible for anyone to best Hugh Fraser's savvy audio performance of Christie's Hickory Dickory Dock, but Rosalind Ayres produces an amazing range of voices and accents to create her own one-woman full-cast audio book. After the death by poisoning of wealthy Rex Fortescue, others in the household are murdered in ways that mimic a Mother Goose rhyme. Ayres's Miss Marple is well-mannered, polite and even diffident. Ayres seems to be mocking stereotypes of British accents. Percival, the elder son, is stuffy and nasally clogged. Lancelot, the younger son, is ironic and cavalier. Ayres can slip effortlessly from one accent to another, as when the lofty voice of Rex's secretary collapses into the low-class accent of an East Ender after she discovers her boss's body. The greatest mystery in this 1953 novel is why any mid-century father would name his children Lancelot and Percival. Though the story lacks action and enough Jane Marple for Ayres to develop, her performance is a delightful romp for any Christie fan.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Daniel Silva isn&rsquo;t quite LeCarre. He&rsquo;s a more modern breed, with some major DNA overlap. (Other DNA-sharing: Graham Greene, Joseph Kanon, Alan Furst.) When it comes to the vast club of practitioners of international spycraft, Silva is a cut above them all, andThe English Girlis a masterwork.  --Neal Thompson--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.", "title": "The English Girl (Gabriel Allon)", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Books": 2734}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YWOczQDOL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["006207315X", "0062073141", "0451233999", "0451230663", "0451224507", "0451215737", "0451227387", "0451208188", "0451221729", "0451213181", "0451211480", "0451209338", "006232005X", "0451209303", "0451209311", "045120932X", "0062320068", "0062253832", "0440246326", "0345526554", "1455521302", "1476717109", "0425267768", "1476764018", "1439193029", "0425264696", "0451419936", "006228732X", "1400079152", "1455575992", "1416595236", "0451466861", "0345530578", "0061785679", "1476717125", "006185932X", "0515153702", "0786032170", "030745469X", "1476764174", "0515145823", "045141411X", "0425262308", "044657306X", "1455521248", "1455525847", "0316069515", "0425250598", "0062330209", "0446573094", "1455527203", "0515147532", "0446556726", "0312587562", "0804178747", "0393346307", "0515148954", "0425259293", "0553572210", "0062072188", "0425260992", "0446618780", "0345537068", "0345505484", "0451417542", "0399159304", "0425264688", "145160792X", "0425261360", "1451640234", "0425267776", "0385347456", "0399149724", "0399160477", "0451232941", "0425248607", "1455503169", "1250046459", "1476754748", "0770435726", "0446572985", "0143125478", "1451648960", "1439192979", "1416595198", "1455576425", "1455521205", "1400069491", "1455550671", "0425265056", "1451608276", "0345540239", "0399164154", "0061656011", "0440246199", "034552652X", "1416595228", "0786031824", "0141019085", "0525953094"], "bought_together": ["006207315X", "0062073141"], "buy_after_viewing": ["006232005X", "0451208188", "0451209338", "0451215737"]}}

Our guides to this strange new world are two renegade teenage mercenaries: Durango and Vienne. Durango, the son of a morally corrupt politician, is a rowdy, carefree teen seeking to escape his roots, and he is hopelessly in love with Vienne. We learn about Vienne&#x2019;s past and then see her embark on a dangerous odyssey as she is captured by an enemy corporation and used as a killing machine. This swift read features constant, bombarding action and subplots to spare. Durango&#x2019;s clever banter with his interior sidekick&#x2014;the acerbic Mimi, his former chief who has been installed in his brain as an artificial intelligence system&#x2014;is a highlight, employing the witty, realistic thoughts and retorts of a teen boy. Mimi calls Durango &#x201C;Cowboy,&#x201D; and indeed, there is a strong western flavor to Gill&#x2019;s science fiction. The tense cliff-hanger ending, with a cute Star Wars reference, will leave readers poised for more.

{"asin": "0062073141", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Amazon Exclusive: Daniel Silva on WritingPortrait of a Spywith a PencilWhile on book tour, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to find that readers are fascinated by how writers actually write. Most readers hold in their mind an idealized image of the novelist at work&mdash;a figure in a trendy urban coffeehouse, a solitary figure walking along an empty beach. The truth, however, is seldom so romantic.Before going any further, let us stipulate that, much like the hero of my novels, the art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon, I am something of a creature of habit. I work seven days a week, from early in the morning until six thirty in the evening, when I stop to watch the evening news. My work clothing never varies: gray sweatpants by Russell Athletic, a long-sleeve T-shirt by L.L. Bean, fleece Acorn moccasins, and discount cotton socks from Marks &amp; Spencer in England. Occasionally, visitors to our house will catch a glimpse of this outfit, but, for the most part, my wife and children tend to shield me from public view. As a rule, I don&rsquo;t answer the telephone&mdash;unless it is a family emergency of some sort&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t read e-mail. I nibble rather than eat.Portrait of a Spy, like all the Gabriel Allon novels, was fueled largely by McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits.I have a computer, of course, but I really do most of my actualwritingin longhand, on yellow legal pads. I prefer to work while lying on the floor rather than at my desk. This annoys my wife because she took a great deal of time and effort to have a desk custom made to fit my office. When I showed her a photograph of Muriel Spark, one of her literary heroes, writing in longhand stretched across a floor, she was only partially mollified. Sometimes we talk about living somewhere other than Georgetown. Secretly, the very idea terrifies me. After writing 14 books in the same room of the same house, I am afraid I have lost the ability to work anywhere else.As for my writing instrument of choice, it is unquestionably the pencil. There is something about the sound it makes scratching across the page that, for me, is the essence of composition. The pencil is the antithesis of all things cyber and e, a means of returning, however briefly, to a world that is unconnected and unwired. A pad and pencil do not freeze or crash. There are no viruses or error messages. If a thunderstorm knocks out the power, the words will still be there when the lights come on again. And then, there is the satisfying natural rhythm of the work itself&mdash;the turning of the completed page, the sharpening of the dulled point, the fortnightly disposal of the fluffy wooden shavings.Lately, I have been hoarding pencils. I&rsquo;m not sure precisely when it began; I suspect it had something to do with the death of the typewriter. An irrational fear gripped me, a fear that pencils were next. If the typewriter could go extinct, how could the lowly, environmentally hostile pencil possibly hope to survive in the brave new world? I now order my favorite brand&mdash;the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior No. 2&mdash;by the case. I am reasonably confident I now have enough pencils on hand to see me through the next several novels&mdash;though, if I happen to misplace a pencil, I will search the house thoroughly before removing a new one from its special drawer and sharpening it for the first time. To sharpen a virgin pencil is, in a sense, to commit an act of assisted suicide. It saddens me.I wish it were not so. I wish I could write on a computer while traveling on an airplane or sitting in a strange hotel room, but I cannot. I have become a prisoner of my office. I need my floor, and my Mirado Black Warrior No. 2 pencils, and my McVitie&rsquo;s digestive biscuits. I hoard them, too. I keep them on a special shelf in the storage room, next to my socks from Marks &amp; Spencer.Copyright &copy; Daniel Silva 2011.

Even when cruel Bella Yaga chooses the girl and takes her away to live as her servant, Earwig quickly picks up enough magic to turn the tables on the old witch. Written for a younger audience than most of the magical novels by the late Jones, this early chapter book offers an amusing story in which it takes hard work as well as magic and cleverness to bring about a happy ending.

{"asin": "0062073966", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "Starred Review.Fraser, who played Captain Hastings, the sidekick for arch Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in the PBSMysteryseries, now performs the entire cast in Christie's 1955 mystery. Fraser's Poirot is derivative of the stellar performance of the series' star, David Suchet; nevertheless, Fraser gives Christie's work his own imprimatur. Poirot is absent much of the time in this tale of kleptomania, malice and murder set at a boarding house for students. Add to the mix a number of students from England, a temperamental Greek landlady and an Italian house staff, and one must conclude that Fraser is some sort of magician to keep all the players sorted out as they converge in the common room. Not to be missed among the clamoring voices is Christie's narrative, from which Fraser manages to wring every wry drop. The producers at the Mystery Masters division of the Audio Partners were smart to hire Fraser to record this classic, and listeners will find it a delightful romp that passes all too quickly.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1952, only a few knew he had been diagnosed with manic depression at age 17, and his struggle to conceal this from the world and maintain a \"normal\" life met with varying degrees of success until retirement shook his self-image and he began to slide into his most serious depression. This ordinary but poignant biography, written by his daughter (A Boy of Good Breeding), reconstructs Mel's story in his own voice, which, once established, provides a deeply sympathetic imagining of a manic depressive's interior world. From an early age, Toews's father believed that \"there was no hope for the world, that evil would inevitably triumph over good, and that there was, therefore, no point in striving for goodness. And yet I also felt that the struggle to be good was the purpose of life.\" In Toews's version, Mel eventually turns to writing to make sense of his condition, to review his life in the hope of seeing it more clearly.What engages us is a strong and realistic sense of a man who chose to use the little energy he had to construct a safe world for his family, but one in which he felt he could never fully participate. For Toews, by \"dragging some of the awful details into the light of day,\" she recognized that her father \"found a way to alleviate his pain, and so have I.\"Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Swing Low: A Life", "price": 9.78, "salesRank": {"Books": 218740}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mc3KwzhVL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["1582433224", "1582433402", "0571273564", "B008W2ZG5W", "1582433461", "1582435316", "1616086394", "155152192X", "0889104913"], "bought_together": ["1582433224", "1582433402"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1582433402", "B008W2ZG5W", "1582433224", "1582433461"]}}

The first story starring the bear family,The Big Honey Hunt, appeared in 1962. Since then, more than 340 Berenstain Bears books have been published, and more than 260 million copies have been sold. What began as an idea sparked by their young sons' interest in children's books has become over the years arguably the best-selling children's book series ever.Since their inception, the Berenstain Bears stories have expanded to include picture books, beginning readers, and chapter books--even a hit TV show on PBS. Writing and illustrating the books has become a Berenstain family affair. Mike joined with his parents as a creative team in the late 1980s. The Bear family has expanded over the years as well. Sister Bear arrived in 1974, and baby Honey joined the family in 2000.Since Stan's death at age eighty-two in 2005, Jan and Mike have continued to write and illustrate wonderful new adventures for Mama, Papa, Brother, Sister, and Honey Bear.

{"asin": "0062075497", "categories": [["Books"]], "description": "The Berenstain Bears are celebrating their 50th Anniversary in 2012.Stan  and Jan Berenstain were already successful cartoonists for magazines and adult humor books when they began writing children's books. The first story starring the bear family, The Big Honey Hunt, appeared in 1962. Since then, more than 340 Berenstain Bears books have been published, and more than 260 million copies have been sold. What began as an idea sparked by their young sons' love of reading has become over the years arguably the best-selling children's book series ever.Since  their inception, the Berenstain Bears stories have expanded to include picture books, beginning readers, and chapter books--even a hit TV show on PBS. Writing and illustrating the books has become a Berenstain family affair. Mike joined with his parents as a creative team in the late 1980s. The Bear family has expanded over the years as well. Sister Bear arrived in 1974, and baby Honey joined the family in 2000.Though  Stan died in 2005 and Jan in 2012, Mike continues to create the delightful Berenstain Bear adventures from his studio in Pennsylvania.berenstainbears.com", "title": "The Berenstain Bears and the Tooth Fairy", "price": 12.19, "salesRank": {"Books": 17228}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61k1IRBg7vL.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["0062075489", "0062075470", "0448432528", "0062075500", "0060573880", "0060573937", "0060573813", "0060573945", "0310712572", "0310720915", "0062075519", "0310720869", "0062075535", "0060573821", "0310720842", "0060573929", "0060573910", "0060573953", "0060574275", "0062075551", "0679877061", "0310712475", "0394848365", "0062075543", "0060573961", "0679887431", "0310734878", "0310712556", "B000I8T2CQ", "0060573856", "0060573872", "0394873343", "0394872177", "0394873351", "0394856406", "0679808485", "0394873335", "006057383X", "0310712467", "0394873416", "0679889574", "0394873327", "0679889582", "B007HVQXJC", "0394856392", "0060527781", "0763621757", "0394865707", "0394873319", "0310712505", "039487336X", "1482683555", "0060573848", "0394873394", "0062083023", "0394851323", "B000R7MKD6", "0394837363", "0679864342", "B007FDWKPS", "0394851315", "0062075241", "0394830148", "B00110RR6S", "031071253X", "067988744X", "B0075OXTDO", "0394805666", "B00HQP3CXO", "B003EV6ID0", "0679889604", "067987707X", "0310712513", "0394854438", "0310720826", "B000NJ5UDK", "0394848357", "0394873378", "0679889558", "0394848373", "0679804196", "039489748X", "0310720907", "0679848053", "0448442558", "B0021GSMUG", "0310720850", "0062075357", "B009RWC4ME", "B000R7QH4O", "039483013X", "B005UDO8TG", "0394873386", "037581132X", "0310734894", "0310720893", "B002A80ITS", "0679889590", "0394848381", "0310720877"], "bought_together": ["0448432528"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0448432528", "0394873343", "0763621757", "B000I8T2CQ"]}}
