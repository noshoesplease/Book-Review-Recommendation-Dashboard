I have been in a phase of reading books about kids and/or adults caught in the clutches of cult like  religions, such as the offshoots of the LDS and those like it. This seemed to fit into that category, so I went ahead and bought it. I wish I hadn't spent the money.Truthfully, this book is first off, fairly poorly written. It comes across as one of the types of books one can buy for 99 cents for the Kindle. Also, it seems to be written in such a way as to appeal to those who are looking for titillating scenarios of older men forcing young girls (think ten years old and younger) into extremely sexual situations. I'm not into soft porn (or any porn) nor do I want to hear graphic details of a beyond middle aged man forcing a child to perform oral sex on him. Granted, I assumed that when the synopsis mentioned the girls being forced to get \"married\" at young ages and being \"violated\", it was obvious that one aspect of that would be sexually. But the premise of the book SEEMED to be the aspects involving the mistreatment of the women/girls in the faith more than anything. That wasn't the case however. This book was simply a showcase written to draw in those who want lurid pedophilia type details. So if that is what you are looking for, you'll like this book. If however, your interest lies in reading about religions that are actually cults in disguise or the mistreatment and subjugation of women in certain religions, this isn't the book for you. While that is mentioned of course, it is pretty much mentioned only to relate how the girls were sexually abused... in detail.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Couldn't Even Finish This One", "unixReviewTime": 1297382400, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011"}

From the outside, it makes perfect sense that there's something wrong with an organization when the name, the names of the members, and the locations it operates at must change...ever. It's some pretty strong indoctrination that would keep cult members from experiencing cognitive dissonance over the constant hiding, running, sexploitation of children, destruction of official documents, etc.It's also very interesting that the Children of God's social experiment in not allowing children in the cult to have any personal boundaries was immediately disastrous. The clock can't be turned back on millions of years of human evolution. It's one thing to give up your rights as an adult and join an organization that would dictate your every move, but giving birth to children and not imparting any choices to them is against human nature and incredibly abusive.Many thanks to the brave women who told their story, creating a window into the Children of God (The Family International) cult.

Instead of being children, they were sexual slaves and slaves to the cause for the Children of God cult. This book is quite a read but it's important to realize how the Children of God or the Family International operate in order to destroy them. The Children of God and the Family International is nothing more than a cult focused on sexual orgies with minor children involved such as the young girls on the cover.Their father, Christopher Jones, should have protected them all along. But part of cult culture is the separation of children from their biological parents or those who will protect them from the abuse. Cult culture is bent on secrecy, lies, deception, and illusions.Their late leader, David Berg, was seen as the supreme being rather than a human being. His death did not help in it's organization's deconstruction. Like other cults, the Children of God changed their name to the Family Internationl. The sisters here provide an insider's look into this twisted world where children are routinely abused in various ways particularly sexually.Another issue with this cult is that they move around frequently rather than stay in one place. They keep a low profile and try to maintain a sense of normalcy to outsiders. The insiders like the sisters here write about the illusions to the public and to outsiders such as relatives who visit their loved ones.This book is a triumph against the Children of God for revealing shocking accounts of blatant abuse of children and even it's adult members. The Children of God leaders make decisions for the children and the adults. Their mysterious founder David Berg lived on the run and in hiding much like Bin-Laden. He sent messages through his trusted advisors to his members about the end of the world and how to train soldiers for the end-times.The girls' father Christopher Jones blindly accepted David Berg's leadership and his word as the holy gospel. He believed Berg was a prophet and not a pedophile. Even in the end, I don't think their father realized the overwelming damage that the Children of God inflicted upon his own offspring. Often, he was out of their lives and on missions for the organization. He was a true believer who never doubted his prophet unfortunately.For three sisters, they had to learn to escape the Children of God cult not just physically but emotionally, psychologically, and sexually as well. When you join a cult or are born into one such as the Children of God, your mind is not yours to begin with and neither were their souls and bodies.This book will help in stopping Family International and exposing their practices. The sisters have done a brave job in detailing painful memories and experiences of their lives. My heart goes out to them and all the other survivors.My only complaint about the book is the lack of photographs except for the cover and back. Another complaint is the writing is a bit off.

Not exactly the high-brow life one envisions for royalty. Or that Diana was not a great friend to have and was &#34;off and on&#34; with her few friends.

The second book to feature archeologist and adventurer Daniel Knox and his partner Gaille Bonnard by Will Adams is that rare instance where what we read between the binding actually lives up to the fun promised on the cover. When Egytologist Knox comes across a lid being offered in an Alexandrian marketplace it triggers something at the back of his mind which leads to the Dead Sea Scrolls and the mystery surrounding not only the Exodus but so much more it would not be fair to reveal too much here and spoil your fun.There are plenty of good guys and bad guys, and enough historical proof and speculation to please and enthrall even the layman. Soon Knox finds himself on the run from a bad Egytian Tourist cop named Khaled and a twisted preacher protecting an ancient dig. An Egyptian policeman named Naguib whose wife and child act as his conscience when a young girl's body is found at a dig will try to discover what's going on before it is too late for both Knox, and his love Gaille, who has been abducted. Khaled's character has echos of those 1930's films of this type of adventure, and though set very much in the present, the book also has this feel.You'll have to read this crackling adventure to discover how Akhenaten, Moses, Nefertiti, Adam and Eve, and a hoax which might have an unexpected basis in truth all play out in an Egypt full of ancient secrets. Knox's pal Augustin is on hand, and might find a romance of his own, while Knox realizes finally that his feelings for his mentor's daughter are much deeper than he'd been aware. There is both excitement and danger here, and just the right dash of romance mixed in to the pot, making this a wildly entertaining book which will have you waiting on the next one.

He is amused by the hawker as everyone claims to be his buddy since The Alexander Cipher case.  The lad sets prices based on pure supply and demand of how much he perceives the customer can afford, but refuses to reveal where it was found.Knox visits his friend Omar Tawfiq who lets him browse through his database.  He finds a picture of it, but Omar explains it is not a bowl from Ancient Egypt; instead it is a storage jar lid from Qumran, home of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Soon that lead takes the excited Knox to a dig led by Reverend Ernest Peterson and his team of theological students who seek a portrait of Christ that Peterson plans to keep.  As a murder of a native archeologist occurs, corrupt cops blame Knox while the beleaguered Egyptologist learns in horror from his cell that his partner Gaille Bonnard was abducted near the ruins of Amarna, several hundred miles away.With a strong ancient historical base, the latest Knox antiquities thriller is a fast-paced over the top of the Sphinx entertaining tale.

Sure, this is still a popular genre and could yield more winners, but it seems we aren't having many blockbusters at this point. Adams' book has the necessary elements and moves along briskly, a quick escape perhaps, but not overlly compelling and suffers the flaws of some of its bigger counterparts.The stereotypical religious zealot has been overdone, even though in real life one is hard pressed to find these crazed Christians running around. Or take the snarky comments like (p. 45) about the Bible being intolerant of homosexuality. So disagreeing with something and believing its wrong makes you intolerant? By that reasoning, there are a lot of intolerant atheists out there.Even the pro-Bible character can't get it all right. He claims the Bible isn't strictly factual. Funny, people have been verifing what it states for centuries (i.e.The Old Testament Documents: Are They Reliable & Relevant?,The Big Book of Bible Difficulties). The Akhenaten theories are nothing new. Was he influnced by the Hebrews? Perhaps. The only similarity between him and Moses is their monothiesm. After that, one has to close thier eyes, make some giant leaps of fancy and ignore a lot of contrary facts to think they were the same person.Most historians recoginize the Egyptian allusions in Exodus and see it has evidence of Exodus having basis in reality. The novel gets some of that right (though makes some giant fantasies like \"Hebrew\" being Egyptian), but follows it with a know-it-all character - who is obviously intolerant of the Bible - who ignores all this and shows her ignorance of the Bible.Though first the supposedly pro-bible guy tries to link all of Judaism with Egypt. This guy must be getting his history from the New Age shelf. No doubt there are similarites, mainly cultural or minor details, afterall no people live in total isolation from their neighbors. The \"Judaism stole everything from Egypt\" crowd always neglects to discuss the blinding differences (seeThe Bible among the Myths: Unique Revelation or Just Ancient Literature?). Back to the Bible-intolerant character:p. 81 \"seven day creation\" : Doesn't say that, seeThe Genesis Question. And the original Hebrew only includes certain animals on the Ark (see previous reference). The claim that the Bible is \"contradicted by the historical and archaeological record\" is also laughably false. Again, see the above references why scholars can easily show it is more than just a \"folk history.\" The claim that the Bible wasn't put together after the Babylonian conquest will have scholars laughing theirselves silly.I don't know if this was just the character talking (and she is largely proved wrong later), but the author leaves the ending ambigious. That is the problem with a lot of these books. Big build-up to a potentially earth-shattering revelation, but it ends in more of a whimper. Adams can write a good story, but we shall see where he can bring these characters.

Daniel loves a woman named Gail (I listened to the story so I do not know if this is how her name is spelled); who apparently believed Daniel was her father's lover. This caused a rift between them a while back, but now they are over it and are falling in love. Gail is described as beautiful and is also somewhat generic and bland.The villains of the piece is a crazed fundamentalist preacher who is trying to hide the discovery of the site because he is afraid that people will see the scandalous images of Christ. While I enjoyed the story, I didn't find the revelations or the archaeological elements to be that riveting. Akhenaton is a cool enough character as it is without making him Adam. Just discovering a tomb or undiscovered artifact would be interesting enough. Plus turning the villain into a crazed killer just was a bit too convenient.Overall, this was a nice action orientatd story, but I would like to see Gail and Daniel less sterotypical.

Almost every plot, both main and background, focus on a parent child relationship.  At center we have three generations of fathers and sons creating an environment where horrific crimes against young girls could be permitted.  But every side plot also involved some parent child relationship with a sliding scale of disfunctionality.The plot successfully exposes the pitfalls that can have deadly consequences when we take an end justifies the means approach.  For example, relatives make a surprise visit the lead detective and his very pregnant wife, taking advantage of their kind nature.  They take a very hands off approach to parenting as not to squash their children's inquisitive nature (and it is \"okay\" because she is a child psychologist).  The consequence to this approach is the child inevitably turns out to be a major pain in the butt.  We all know those parents and their kids - this is a universal truth.Later on one of the lead characters is acting as a parent figure to a troubled young man and decides not to give specific instruction to him.  He basically parented good values as long as they were convenient for his needs, but when he needed some trouble taken care of, not a word of what not to do.  In this situation the young man reverts to his old ways, what he knows, and commits a terrible assault.You have on one hand the Preacher, a long since deceased patriarch who through his lies and manipulation has led to the death and general ruination of multiple lives.  And then you have our lead detective who is well on his way to becoming a first time father.  Every generation has the opportunity to make a change to their family path.  The problem usually is people often pick the wrong things to purge, and the worst things to incorporate.The problems I did have with the book were technical in nature.  The translation was a little bumpy and I never felt like that the story ever got into a good flow.  Not helping that cause were the 40 page chapters and multiple side plots going on.  For example we spend a little time with the detective's wife's sister. As I can figure she has escaped an abusive man only to hook up with another one.  Then she receives a threatening phone call from the ex who then proceeds to destroy everything in her new apartment.  The book ends with her moving in with him again (WHAT??).  Then we conveniently get a rapist turning up as a red herring for 5 pages.  Now you see him, now you don't.The biggest problem though was the complete lack of motivation of the whole mystery until the end.  Typically a detective will work through all the angles of the crime and slowly figure out who they are trying to catch.  Sometimes you get to spend time with the criminal which will add meaning to the plot, but here we only get to spend time with the victims in which we learn that the criminal hurts them, is nice to them, repeat until dead.  Essentially at the end the perpetrator is arrested and then he explains the whys, because you have no clue until then.

I wonder if it is the subconscious thought of a cold and biting landscape; perhaps those Swiss commercials for hot chocolate and throat drops? No matter the reason, Camilla Lackberg and The Preacher left me chilled and shivering the whole book through!This second installment in the series is set in the coastal town of Fjallabacka and brings back the main character of Erica Falk, who is now side-lined with the  impending birth of her first child. This novel shifts focus to the local police force which includes the father of her baby, Peter. Peter is lead investigator on the report of a missing girl that soon turns to a death investigation.  This murder is just the first in a string of missing young women.  While Erika does some assisting with her investigative research skills, Peter is the real detective and lead investigator.  He is also responsible for his detective team, a hodge-podge of local yokels who do little but slow him down and boggle the investigation.  Peter has more than that to contend with, though, as his one case soon turns into a manhunt for a possible serial killer.This book is a delight for some many reasons--it is as frightening as it is funny. I ran the full gamut of emotions while reading and found myself reluctant to put the book down for even a moment until I finished the whole thing. Lackberg's writing style is masterful as she draws the reader cleverly in, making us care about every character in the book. While the mystery and killings are puzzling and brilliantly done, the best part of the story really takes place in the lives of the characters and their relationships to one another.  This is one of the few books that I've read where I became emotionally invested in every character, both main and secondary, likable and unlikable.  It started to feel less like a book and more real, with each character becoming a person, with motives and aims that was a puzzle to me.  I kept asking myself, `How does this fit?'  `Why is he acting this way/saying these things?'.Overall, one of the best murder mysteries/thrillers I've read in a long time.  The only bad news?

Cole", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "First Line: The day was off to a promising start.It's summer in Fj&auml;llbacka, Sweden. Erica Falck is close to the end of her pregnancy, and her partner, police detective Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m, has taken some vacation time to be with her. Unfortunately, the body of a young German woman is found on the beach, and Patrik is called in to lead the investigation. Since the heat has turned Erica into one continuous mood swing, Patrik is ashamed to admit that he's looking forward to getting back to work.When the bones of two young women are discovered buried beneath the German woman, speculation is high that the skeletons are of two young women who disappeared in the area in 1979. Patrik now has more work than ever before which means that Erica is left unwillingly on the sidelines to deal with freeloading relatives who like to show up uninvited on the doorstep of any family member who owns beachfront property away from the city.For me, the weakness of this book was in its plot. The title of the book itself turned out to be a big clue, and the solution was clear to me early on-- including the answer to the DNA question that was stumping all of the police. Fortunately the plot was only a minor irritant to me because what I like so much about L&auml;ckberg's books isn't her plotting, but her marvelous cast of characters.Although it was disappointing that Erica Falck took a backseat in this investigation, she was left in charge of the comic relief. Her reactions to some of the freeloaders showing up at her house made me laugh and cheer (and be extremely thankful for having family and friends who never just \"show up\" for free room and board).L&auml;ckberg's cast of characters is a large one, and even though they're not all likable, they are all very well drawn. During the course of the investigation, I came to know about their lives and personalities, and I have definite favorites as well as a character or two whom I believe just has to go.The Preacher may be the second book in this series, but it stands very well on its own. If you're a character-driven reader, as I am, and if you're willing to overlook a weak bit here and there in the plot, you're going to be amply rewarded with a wonderful cast of characters.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lackberg's characters are wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 1313712000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2011"}

When Forensics lifts the body, they find the skeletal remains of two more victims.  Mellberg asks Patrik to lead the investigation as his other detectives, Martin lacks experience and Ernst lacks imagination; Martin resents not getting a chance to lead and Ernst rages over the Kid getting another case.Patrik believes the older skeletons are female teens, Siv Lantin and Mona Thernblad, who vanished in 1979.  The autopsies affirm that each victim was tortured in a deliberate simmering manner until death provided relief.  The latest deceased is identified as German Tanja Schmidt.  Time becomes precious when a young girl vanishes without a trace while evidence points to the Hult family.The keys to this strong Swedish police procedural (see The Ice Princess) are the profound look inside the souls of the key players to learn what motivates each them; including negative incentives and the discerning glimpse into group dynamics when time is running out.  Using flashbacks to 1979 to tell the tale of the Hult evangelical healers who are involved in the present day investigation enhances the overall tension.  Although Erica's sister Anna's domestic problems with her ex add to the look at what moves people, this subplot takes away from an otherwise taut Swedish whodunit.Harriet Klausner", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "strong Swedish police procedural", "unixReviewTime": 1328572800, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2012"}

He, somewhat reluctantly, since his girlfriend is eight months pregnant, agrees to visit the scene of the crime, but once he arrives there he comes to realize that he did the right thing, since apart of the body of the woman they also recover the bones of two other females who presumably died many years before.As the mystery deepens and the plot thickens, and some ghosts from the distant past come out in the open again, we spend some time watching Patrik's girlfriend Erica, a usually overactive soul as she tries to come to terms with her boredom, but also survive the visits of some of her relatives that only remember that she exists when the holiday season arrives. At the same time we take a look at the everyday lives of the members of an unusual family who, one way or another, have a lot of secrets to hide and are not in good terms with the police, or with anyone at that.Patrik, despite his constant worrying about Erica, has to work hard and fast to get results, because there's pressure on the cops from everyone; from the local politicians and the media, as well as from the shop owners who see their businesses suffer big losses, as the tourists start to leave the town in a rush. But no matter how much he wants to solve the case as fast as he can, luck will not to prove to be on his side, as a young woman will soon disappear from the face of the earth, leaving behind no trace, and everyone will think that the killer is behind the new crime as well. As one would expect tensions rise and the police has a lot of explaining to do. Patrik, keeping a cool head, couldn't care less about the press and the politicians but he knows that things have to start moving faster. And they do. And it's exactly then when he comes to realize that these two crimes are somehow connected with some others which took place twenty five years ago. But, how could that be? The prime suspect for those incidents is dead, so it really doesn't make any sense. Or does it?Through the thoughts and the memories of her heroes, and through official and unofficial documents, the author takes us back in time and brings to light some appalling secrets, she talks about religious zealotry and the deceits that go with it, and she points out the fact that some people are simply too weak to escape their past and come to terms with modern day reality.This is not so much an action packed thriller as a mystery story. The author simply takes a dive into the minds and souls of these characters in order to present them as they really are; weak, and wicked and full of faults. Everything happens for a reason, she seems to think, and as the story progresses she proves just that, by bringing together the various threads and leading the reader to the grand finale.However, she's not only interested in crime and the darkness of the psyche, but also in love; especially the forbidden love, but also the love which can only reach its peak by following many different and hard travelled paths. Everything is fair in love and war, the saying goes, and the good author seems to agree with that. But she also seems to think that even in love there are some gray areas.The Preacher is yet another great crime novel by a Swedish writer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Another great crime novel from Sweden", "unixReviewTime": 1313971200, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "A319KYEIAZ3SON", "asin": "000725394X", "reviewerName": "Mary Whipple", "helpful": [29, 29], "reviewText": "(3.5 stars) As readers of Camilla Lackberg's previous novel, The Ice Princess, have discovered, Fjallbacka, Sweden, a small fishing village in western Sweden, holds many secrets, some of them involving murder.  Chief Investigator Patrik Englund is enjoying a much-needed vacation when he learns that a six-year-old has discovered a woman's naked and beaten body near a ravine.  Underneath that body are the skeletons of two more women who disappeared in 1979.  Autopsies prove that all three had been slowly tortured over the course of many days before merciful death interceded.  Through flashbacks to 1979, when the first deaths occurred, the story develops into a murderous saga which may involve the Hult family, whose family patriarch, Ephraim Hult, was a highly successful evangelical preacher, and whose two sons Johannes and Gabriel had supernatural healing powers when they were children.  Ephraim is now dead, and his sons are enemies as a result of Ephraim's will.The author spends as much time on the lives and motivations of her characters as she does on plot development, and when yet another young girl disappears from town, Patrik and his crew (which also has their own frictions and rivalries) realize they may have a chance to find her before she dies of the same tortures which were inflicted on the previous young women.  Dozens of complications, which are revealed through the family backgrounds, psychology, and interactions of the police officers, the victims, and the various members of the Hult family keep the tension high as Lackberg involves the whole community in a wide assortment of clues and red herrings.Although the dialogue is often wooden and clich&eacute;d, the author's emphasis on characters and why they behave as they do give a depth to this novel that straight action-mysteries do not usually have.  Flashbacks in italics inserted throughout the present day action reveal the thoughts of an imprisoned female victim from 1979, held in a cold dark place, as she tries to cope with another day of torture. Blackmail, revenge, an obsession with power, seething resentments spawned by injustice, and love and passion are all motivating forces which one sees here through the various characters.  There are, however, many implausibilities in the plot.  A number of characters, some of them repeating, add little to the story line except diversion.  Erika's sister's problems, a big part of The Ice Princess, for example, continue here as a distraction, and the late addition of the character of Kennedy Karlsson, with his unusual background, seems to be a convenient way out of a messy plot issue.It is easy, however, to see why Camilla Lackberg is the best selling author in Swedish history, outselling even Stieg Larsson in number of books sold:  She has written nine #1 sellers in Sweden, good escape novels (of which the Ice Princess is #1 and this is #2) that keep the reader entertained, involved in the action, and willingly \"suspending disbelief\" throughout.  Two more of her pop novels are already being translated for the US market (by Steven T. Murray, translator of the Stieg Larsson books and those by Henning Mankell), and one would hope that her later novels will show her increasing growth as a novelist.

Read the Preacher in English. Read the Stonecutter in Norwegian. Every book is probably 20% too long. An editor would not be so buried in the act of writing to notice that the same rhetorical figure appears five times in 15 pages, like in 'the Preacher'. One is reminded of the phrase, \"great writing comes from rewriting\". Similarly, some character imagines him/herself pouring food over the head of a person s/he scorns/dislikes/despises three times in all. We need a different revenge scenario than a one-sided food fight. A real editor might pick up on this too.Even the translation needs an editor. It rattles between the American and the English vernacular, often in the same sentence. It is unbelievably annoying inasmuch as it hews very closely to the original text, such that every Scandinavism shouts out from behind the English prose. The leaden 'f' words are forced and other profane tropes are glaringly unidiomatic. Now I know that Norwegian is not Swedish. However, I read Swedish as well and the difference is not so large. In Norwegian, the author lards her prose with Americanisms. I have to assume that this is what she does in the Swedish original. In fact, she does this to such a degree that it is not really Norwegian [or Swedish] at all. It is all American phrases using Norwegian/Swedish words.This author is no wordsmith. Mankell uses the very words themselves to create a feeling, an atmosphere, a reflection of the character's mind. Jo Nesbo is a clever verse maker; his songs for his rock group 'De Derre' are witty and thoughtful. L&auml;ckberg writes flat, colorless sentences, copied from American TV and middlebrow magazines. The translation is cut and paste, blocky rock hopping.I understand why she is getting so much press. Mankell sent Wallander to Alzheimers' limbo. Stig Larsson is dead. Jo Nesbo is Norwegian.

The first, \"The Ice Princess,\" was widely accepted as on a par with the best of the recent Scandinavian noir novels.  As with that debut book, this novel also is set in the small fishing village of  Fjallbacka and is a police procedural that seems to drag until the miracle of science, rather than good old-fashioned footwork, brings it to a conclusion.The plot is relatively simple:  A body is discovered, with the remains of two skeletons over 24 years old underneath.  It's up to the local police, led by detective Patrik Hedstrom, to conduct the investigation.  Customarily, they usually look into bicycle thefts.  Then two more women go missing, increasing the pressure.  Attention centers on one family, the offspring of a man known to all as the Preacher:  misfits, religious fanatics and criminals.The length of the novel seems overly long, and probably could have used some judicious editing.  And the translation does not seem to be up to the level of \"The Ice Princess.\"  Nevertheless, the story is clever, and the plot twists, which in a sense were somewhat obvious, keep the reader moving ahead.  Despite these misgivings, the book is an enjoyable read, and one hopes for US editions of the author's other five novels.

In this follow-up novel,also set in the Swedish coastal town of Fjallbacka,  a female German tourist's body is found atop two skeletons which turn out to be the remains of two young women who went missing in 1979. Patrik Hedstrom, the policeman who helped crack the murder case in \"The Ice Princess\" returns in this second novel with a much more prominent role. He is now married to Erica, the author from the first novel who played a major role in solving the murder in \"The Ice Princess\". Though it isn't necessary to read \"The Ice Princess\" before this second novel, there is quite a bit of background information provided in the first novel about some of the recurring characters such as Erica, Patrik, and Erica's sister Anna. Patrik is put in charge of the investigation, and as the investigators dig deeper, they find that all clues point to the Hult family, comprising patriarch Gabriel, his wife Liane, children Linda and Jacob, and also Gabriel's estranged nephews Robert and Stefan and their mother Solveig. When another young girl goes missing, Patrik and his team find themselves racing against the clock to locate the girl, even as they find themselves faced with dead ends and false clues.\"The Preacher\" is quite weak in comparison to \"The Ice Princess\" - firstly, I was disappointed that Erica does not play a major role in this investigation. Instead she is relegated to playing the expectant mom and wife who has to deal with pesky relatives invading her home during the hot summer months. In \"The Ice Princess\", Erica played a very important role in the murder investigation and I had come to genuinely like her character so it was underwhelming to see her character take a backseat to Patrik's role as chief investigator in this second installment. Though Patrik is a likable enough character, he lacks the charisma of other major characters in series such as Inspector Sejer in Karin Fossum's novels which are far superior than Ms. Lackberg's novels (the quality of writing, characterization, etc). The story itself could have benefited from better editing, it tends to plod at many points in the novel, and some story arcs could have been omitted. One in particular is the story about Anna, Erica's sister - her domestic problems continue in this second novel, but prove to be more of a distraction and annoyance than an engaging story arc. Final verdict - \"The Preacher\" is not as engaging as \"The Ice Princess\", and there are other Scandinavian mystery authors whose works I find more interesting, such as Karin Fossum, Johan Theorin, Arnaldur Indridasson, Henning Mankell, Steig Larssen, etc.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Long-winded and not as engaging as \"The Ice Princess\"", "unixReviewTime": 1259193600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2009"}

For character-driven readers like me, they're perfect to immerse myself in when I'm in the mood to spend time with characters who've come to feel as though they're friends. You also never know just what's going to happen, because the lives of these characters do not run smoothly.Hedstr&ouml;m and Falck have had to learn how to be a couple, how to juggle their separate careers, and how to be parents. Erika's sister and her two children have had a very difficult time of their own, and we get to see them adjusting to a new chapter in their lives. We know what's going on in the lives of each person who works with Patrik-- even Melberg, the boss who drives everyone insane. Melberg's private life comes into the spotlight for a while in The Stranger, and this glimpse gives him an added depth that the usual pain-in-the-neck boss just doesn't have in the typical police procedural. The individual cast members of the reality TV show also come under scrutiny since they are all considered suspects. It does sound like a huge cast, but I had no difficulties in keeping everyone straight.The only thing that kept The Stranger from becoming one of my top reads for the year was the fact that the identity of the killer was crystal clear to me very early on. However, I certainly did enjoy watching Hedstr&ouml;m and his team conduct their investigations into the two deaths, finding clues and piecing them together in this strongest book of the series so far.If you like to learn a bit about another country, be a part of intricate investigations, and immerse yourself in the lives of fictional characters, then I certainly recommend crime fiction written by Camilla L&auml;ckberg.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One of my favorite mystery series", "unixReviewTime": 1403913600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2014"}

All these have elements in common- primarily the twisted thread of painfully accumulated evidence from interviews and combing records eventually leading up to the capture of the murderer after a violent denoument. Along side the procedural details there are one or more subplots usually involving the policeman's hard lot in maintaining a happy home life in the face of all the long hours he spends on the murder cases. All these elements are present in \"The Stranger\".Parts of the story read like a soap opera as we follow the hero's girl friend planning her wedding,choosing a dress, music for the reception etc.Something that sets \"The Stranger\" apart from many others is the large number of named characters-I counted 80 in a 370 page book- many of the 80 were children,or minor characters, but surely this must come close to the records set in Russian novels.The serious part of the plot concerns a rather far-fetched series of revenge murders seemingly unrelated but which the detectives manage to link together and zero in on a very surprising conclusion.

The producers encourage drama and conflict between the cast members for higher ratings, but now there has been a murder. The crime continues to take center stage, overshadowing the death of a local woman which at first appears to be an accident and then looks to be something more sinister. Now it's up to Detective Patrik Hedstrom to get to the bottom of both cases, while still finding time for his fianc&eacute;e and daughter.I began reading this series last year and have been looking forward to reading \"The Stranger\" for several weeks. I love this series because of the two main characters, Patrik and his fianc&eacute;e Erica, as well as for the complex plots. The books in this series do a great job balancing the details of crime investigations with the personal life of the characters. There are also flashback scenes from the past that tie into a current crime that lend an added element of intrigue to the story.I was mesmerized by this novel from the beginning, but it's not my favorite in this series. Unlike some of the prior books, I was able to piece together many parts of the mystery before the detectives. I still enjoyed the book; both cases held my interest and I liked reading about the wedding plans Erica was making with the help of her sister Anna. However, I wish Erica would have had a more substantial part in the main story of the book. There are some great scenes between Erica and her sister, but not enough with her and her best friend Dan or between her and Patrik, but Erica is too strong of a character to be a mere subplot.  I am pleased that an event at the end sets up the plot of the next book and seems to guarantee Erica will be a major part of the story. I am glad to see some of Anna's problems have been resolved, but I'm not sure if I like the direction the author has taken with her love life. I'm curious and a little anxious to see how that changes the dynamic between the characters.Patrick does a wonderful job in the investigation by tracking down clues and in leading the other detectives while Chief Mellberg is predictably too pre-occupied with his own personal life to lead his team. While obviously incompetent as a boss, I actually feel sorry for Mellberg in this book and am curious to see what happens next for him in future installments.Most of the characters connected to the reality show are interchangeable. However, I still think their stories end a bit too abruptly. We get glimpses into their lives and their problems, but I was surprised there wasn't more of their reactions after the case their fellow contestant is finally solved. I would have also liked to have seen more of what Jonna will do next, but I was pleased that based on the ending, there is a chance one of the young men could be seen in future books.\"The Stranger\" was a bit more predictable than other books in the series, but also thankfully, less gory. I was a bit disappointed mostly because I have grown to love this series so much, I had higher expectations for the book. However, I still found it to be a page-turner, and I think fans of the series will enjoy the book in spite of its faults. Even though parts seem rushed, the story still captures the reader's attention and doesn't let go. New readers who like the Scandinavian mystery/thriller genre or like to see a blend of police procedural and family life of the detectives as in novels by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles or Deborah Crombie, will like the latest by Camilla L&auml;ckberg.I received this book from NetGalley through the courtesy of Open Road Integrated Media in exchange for an honest review.Note:  This review is of the 2013 Kindle version for the United States.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Intriguing Scandinavian mystery with wonderful main characters", "unixReviewTime": 1368057600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2013"}

Swedish crime sensation and No. 1 international bestseller, Camilla Lackberg's fourth psychological thriller - for fans of Stieg Larsson and Jo Nesbo. A woman is found dead, apparently the victim of a tragic car crash. It's the first in a spate of seemingly inexplicable accidents in Tanumshede and marks the end of a quiet winter for detective Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m and his colleagues. At the same time a reality TV show is being shot in the town. As cameras shadow the stars' every move, relations with the locals are strained to breaking point. When a drunken party ends with a particularly unpopular contestant's murder, the cast and crew are obvious suspects. Could there be a killer in their midst? As the country tunes in, the bodies mount up. Under the intense glare of the media spotlight, Patrik faces his toughest investigation yet...My wife read this about a month ago, and was quite insistent that I get to it. After all I had inflicted it on her. Suffice to say she didn't particularly enjoy it much; ok - not at all then! I've been avoiding it for a couple of weeks, in the hope I could delay it until May and count it as my Scandinavian read for the month which is one of my own personal reading challenges in 2013. One of the many things I love about my wife is her persistence!This was a 390'ish page book where not very much seemed to happen at the beginning, other than we spend a lot of time with the chief investigator's family. In fact throughout the book we spend a lot of time with Hedstrom's wife, Erica and sister, Anna......who I'm guessing suffered some \"event\" in one of the author's previous books. Most of the time, I enjoy stories where detectives or investigators personal lives are shown to us. I need to see another side to them, apart from the job. It adds flesh to their bones and gives them substance. Here it bored me unfortunately.After maybe the halfway point the pace picked up a bit and there were some interesting developments. The investigation into the car crash victim developed with other similar cases uncovered. I did guess the identity of the killer early, and as I'm no Sherlock Holmes perhaps it wasn't concealed as cunningly as the author thought it had been. Conversely, it could have been her intention to telegraph the culprit to the reader. She did cleverly link the two crimes of reality show murder victim and drunk driver together.The supporting cast of police investigators were on the whole likeable and fairly believable. Perhaps my favourite was Gosta. Initially jaded and uninterested, counting down the days until he could get out on the golf course; he became invigorated and brought his A-game to the investigation. Maybe his transformation stretched the bounds of credibility a little bit, but as I liked him I'll buy this one.There were a couple more downsides to the book in my opinion. I felt the minor back story with the chief of police, Mellberg was clich&eacute;d and predictable. The ending where she served up a hook for her next book was annoying, irritating and blatantly unsubtle and patronising to an intelligent readership.I enjoyed the second half of the book more than the first, despite the gripes mentioned above. I do have another book of hers to read, The Drowning. It won't be something I'll be rushing to in a hurry. As a further sidenote, my 2012 edition states that the author was the 9th best-selling author in Europe in the previous year. She must have a very big family, I reckon.2 from 5I bought this new for my wife earlier this year from Buzzard Books in my hometown.

Harry Hole was too drunken, Salander was too weird, and frankly the whole genre seemed too angst-ridden and downright miserable to be enjoyable...and I say that as someone hardened by years of dealing with drunks and screwed-up mavericks - all fictional, of course! At the time of my disillusionment, a fellow Amazon reviewer tried to get me to read L&auml;ckberg, promising that she was different. Finally, I've followed that advice - and I'm so glad I did! Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m is that rare and precious creature - a sober, likeable, intelligent detective who works within the rules and has a happy home life. And in this story he proves that that can be considerably more interesting and much more enjoyable than reading yet one more description of binge-drinking, hangovers and cowboy policing.When Patrik is called to the scene of a fatal car accident, it looks like a straightforward case of drunken driving. But the woman driver was teetotal and Patrik suspects that there may be more to the accident than meets the eye. Meantime the town has been invaded by a reality TV show starring a group of C-List celebs whose claim to fame is that they are willing to get outrageously drunk, party all night and have sex as often as they can, and all with the cameras rolling. This is problem enough, but when one of the celebs turns up dead in a bin, Patrik has two cases to deal with. So it's lucky there's a new member of the team - Hanna, an experienced and efficient officer has transferred to the district - especially since more deaths are on the way...Well written, and well translated by Steven T Murray, this is an intriguing police procedural with a dark and complex plot and a satisfying conclusion. Although Patrik is the lead character, we get to know the members of his team too and their interactions add an extra layer of depth to the story. The picture L&auml;ckberg paints of contemporary Sweden is as misery-laden and angst-filled as the most ardent Nordic fan could desire, but is lightened by Patrik's family life as he and Erica prepare for their forthcoming wedding. Although there's clearly a running story in the background about Patrik and Erica's relationship, this book works well as a standalone for anyone who, like me, hasn't read the previous ones in the series - an omission I now intend to rectify.

Camilla L&auml;ckberg is one of those writers who have started becoming more and more popular in the west mainly because of her characters. Detective Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m and his writer wife Erica, do not only seem to be everyday people, but also people with big hearts, who can feel the pain of the others, whose psyches are deeply scarred by the past, and who care more for justice than anything else.In \"The Stranger\" there are too many people circling around them, but also around the rural area where they live, and mostly where Patrik works: the chief of the Tanumshede police station who's as lazy as they come; a cop who lives and breathes in boredom; another cop who's finally got a lucky break; and finally a new transfer, an ambitious woman who at some point in the future wants to become chief of police herself.And these are the people that only reside in the police station. Add to them an ambitious politician, a mysterious psychologist, the cast and the production team of a reality show, an old woman desperately in love, as well as another old woman that lives all alone in the wilderness, and you almost get the full picture. I say almost, because most of these people have a lot of secrets to hide and a lot of pain that weighs on their shoulders.L&auml;ckberg seems to be more interested in dissecting the society than giving the readers a mystery; in making them think about everyday life, instead of trying to solve the puzzles. A road accident turns out to be a murder. Then another murder takes place that puts the city and the cops on the spotlight. And Patrik is caught in the middle of two investigations that seemingly have nothing to do with each other, even though there's a chance they do. One can feel sympathy for some of the characters and their strife, but this is not an angelic world we live in, so most of them simply make him dislike them.The author seems to enjoying playing with the reader's perceptions. What is good and what is evil? Would you act any differently if you were in the perp's shoes? Can you really judge a person by his or her looks? Can somebody escape the past unscathed?If you are looking for an overcomplicated mystery, you'll like parts of this book; but if you're searching for a novel that speaks about damaged people and the many evils of modern society you'll simply love it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Victims of their own past", "unixReviewTime": 1366934400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2013"}

When more bodies start to add up, including the unpopular star of a reality star filming in town, things aren't adding up. Poor Patric who is trying to plan his wedding to his longtime love and mother of his daughter must now try to solve this baffling mystery with cameras rolling and the country watching.My rating: 3 StarsMy opinion: In my previous reviews regarding Ms. Lackberg's works, I have referenced the \"lightness\" and focus on emotions of her books compared to her contemporaries in Nordic Noir. I have stated that I thought that her books were too almost Americanized than the darkness and twistedness that is seen in other Nordic Noir books. I thought she was getting away from this in her book THE STONE CUTTER. However, it was back with a vengeance in this book. As a reader of heavier more twisted Nordic Noir books, I have difficulties with this, but do read her works regularly as I am frequently asked for NN recommendations.Source: Edelweiss for PegasusWould I recommend? : I regularly recommend Ms. Lackberg's novels for those either new to Nordic Noir and need a gentle introduction or fans of authors such as Lisa Gardner.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Too Nordic Noir Light", "unixReviewTime": 1365724800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2013"}

The psychological theme of motherhood and its effects on both mothers and children&#8212;for good and for bad, is also a huge part of the storyAnd then there is an annoying aspect, from this reader's perspective. Obnoxious characters from a reality show that is being filmed in this town of Fj&auml;llbacka, in Tanum Municipality. Their contribution is mostly like a distraction, and an uninteresting one, at that. There must have been another way to write their part; but, I digress&#8230;And finally, some characters are a true testament to narcissism, obnoxiously or sadly so. And some are not bad, per se, just narcissistic. So there is a mix of joyful and tragic, happy and gloomy. Some characters work through their tragedy in a good way, some do not.

For one thing, it's a feast of life stories and love stories. There are a great many characters, and their lives are fascinating to follow. There are various couples in various states of bliss, suffering, deception and crisis. And happily, the lead detective, Patrik Hedstrom, is an intelligent, purposeful and essentially happy man in love with his partner, about to marry her, and crazy about their little daughter. This gives an upbeat quality to the narrative, which is very welcome in a mystery full of distressing murders.Yet despite all the human interest, this is a nitty-gritty police procedural replete with autopsies, interviews and research, all well described. The several cops at the Tanumshede police station are engaging and some of them surprise the reader with unexpected insights. I liked them all. Even the unpleasant boss is somewhat sympathetic.While two murder investigations keep the cops busy, a reality show is being filmed in Tanumshede. This adds a nice touch of chaos to the plot.The denouement is full of surprises. I admired the inventiveness of the author in developing the backstory behind the killings.My husband gave me this book.

A local entrepreneur has arranged this group of unconventional people to live and be televised in his home town, expecting a lot of good PR and finances to make this an excellent adventure.At the same time Patrik has received a call about a body found in a car. Just as he is to go out the front door, his new policewoman shows up. She is pretty and blonde and very energetic, her goal is to become Chief in a large city. At the scene Patrik feels something is off but can't quite place it. A local woman, with a strong smell of alcohol is dead behind the wheel of the car. As the investigation moves on, Patrik's 'gut feeling' is born out.  His boss, Mellberg, the man who does nothing, finds a new outside life and Patrik proceeds with his investigation the way it should be done.At home, Patrik and Erica are planning their wedding, or, at least, they are planning to be married. Erica's sister, Anna, and her two children live with them. Anna has had a tragic event take place and is deep in depression. The one unusual event that takes place that jars Anna out of her depression is so far fetched that it is not believable.As the Reality TV series amps up, many unpleasant events occur, and another body is discovered.  Patrik is the man of the hour, and one of the best detectives in a series. He has a sixth sense when something is not right, and he goes to great lengths to follow up on every lead. He and Erica are the personification of a real couple, loving, supportive, and tired, all the time. A new baby, Maja has brightened their lives, and left them exhausted.

While I enjoyed the first 3 very much, sometimes for the flashback sub-plots more than the mysteries, this one had a sub-par plot and mystery. More interesting for me in this one, and I have read the whole series, was the relationship between Patrik and Erica and family. Lackberg continues the Peyton Place like atmosphere of the small Swedish town and all of her books have something to do with parenthood, on some level, and this is no exception. She does an excellent job of setting the reader up for the next in the series, which is also good but somewhat predictable. A strong series but, for me, most of the interest comes as much from the plot lines of the characters (her sister, the police captain, Erica & Patrik, etc.) as it does from the mysteries.

I loved the way the author built up the mystery and kept adding to it so you got a nice rounded story.  There was no pulling out a mystery character at the end, the author drew you toward the final conclusion.  Each of the characters in the story were well thought out and gave their own bit of personality to the complete story.The author had several different stories going on at once and I wasn't sure how they were all going to be connected at first, but the author did tie everything together gradually through the book so you weren't left out in the field wondering which path was going to lead you to the chocolate prize at the end.Even though this was book 4 in the Fj&auml;llbacka stories, I felt that you could read this as a stand-alone without having read the other three. This book was not originally written in English, the translator, Steven T. Murray, did a great job getting the translation correct so it did not feel like I was listening to a book with incorrect English terminology.The Narration ReviewThis audiobook was narrated by Simon Vance and he did a great job with the characters and the accents in this story.  One good thing about a narration is when the narrator makes you forget that you are listening to a single person narrating a book and completely draws you in so it feels like you are listening to a group of people.  Simon Vance did that.  His voice was clear and his narration had good inflections. He didn't just read the story it was more like he was feeling the story and his voice reflected the feelings and emotions of the characters right to me.** Note **I received this audiobook free from the Audio Jukebox Solid Gold Reviewer Program and HighBridge Audio in exchange for an honest review.

Three things happen in the town to set off a wide-ranging investigation.First, Fjallbacka is invaded by a reality television show, with all the attendant problems and a cast motivated to drink, have sex and act in public to excess.  And then, there is a local woman, known to abhor alcohol, who dies in a car crash with a blood level containing enormously high levels of alcohol.  Then one night, after a drunken orgy, one of the contestants on the show is found murdered.

It was terribly sad, but also terribly all too real. There are people in the world like Vanessa's evil step mother, and their victims all too often cover up the horror and dread they face each day, fearing an even greater punishment if they tell anyone. And worse, when they do break their silence, they are not believed by the very people who should protect them. I'm glad Vanessa found happiness at last, although she did take care of her insane step mother til the end and even facing death, this crazy evil woman would not give Vanessa the answers she sought. This book is a testament to the will of the human spirit to survive.I had to wonder, however, if the memories of foretelling the future weren't Vanessa's rewriting of her memory (not intentionally) and the zoning out in a daze sounded like disassociation to me - a precursor sometimes to multiple personalities. The visions and imaginary companions were a little schizophrenic. Not denying that premonitions and communication with spirits do exist, however, the human mind will conjure up whatever it has to to survive. It would be understandable, under the circumstances, if this is how she dealt with things, to keep her sanity (sort of).None of that matters, however, as this book is a great look inside the more dysfunctional of families (although I'd faint if I met a *functional* family.) I'm a RN who works with families in crisis when all the secrets and skeletons fall out of the closet and you have to wonder if these people are putting you on. Sadly they are not.

But with so much to live up to, there is also the slight worry that the book you are looking forward to will suffer from the unfortunate affliction dubbed sequelitis. Playing With Fire though not only matches the first book but - if this is even possible, considering the high standards of Skulduggery Pleasant - exceeds it.Playing With Fire opens with a bang of a scene, making it very clear that the action and (most importantly to me) the humour of the first are still very much there. The moment I had to set the book down for a minute in that opening as I was laughing so hard I knew that I voice I loved from the first book was still very much there. That wit and snark and all-around humour is one of the most appealing things about this series, so when it is in full form (like it is here in Playing With Fire) it makes for a wonderful read.While Skulduggery himself is a wonderful character - and really, how could he be anything but? - I must confessed that young Valkyrie Cain has swiftly taken over the position of first place. She is a brilliant character - strong, intelligent, brave - and overall a delight to read. After reading a number of books with \"heroines\" that have no personality or anything to bring them to life Valkyrie is impressive and that is putting it mildly. Likable characters can make an otherwise average book into a good one, but brilliant characters like Valkryie, Skulduggery and the rest of the cast turn a book with an exciting plot and great world-building into something that is hard to top.Speaking of plot, Playing With Fire's is nicely-paced and packed with great moments of action and character development, plus some nice twists and turns to keep things interesting - I don't think I can say much more for fear of spoiling. Just know that if you enjoyed Skulduggery Pleasant, then I think you will enjoy the way the series is continuing and growing.

I have to say, Landy didn't disappoint me: he kept the action coming and placed enough intrigue into the book that you just knew something else was going to happen, but you're just not quite sure what.Needless to say, when the pair realize that Baron Vengeous is out to bring the Grotesquery back to life to call the Faceless Ones they know they have some serious damage control to take care of.  Why you ask?  Because if the Faceless Ones return that will be the end of the world.  Nothing major, you know!I am totally loving these books and can't wait for the third one to come out in August.  Landy really keeps you on the edge of your seat with the situations he puts his characters in and the way he paces the story.Notes on the Cover:Skulduggery and Valkyrie running with fire in hand is visually appealing, but I have a problem with Valkyrie smiling.  Not that I begrudge the girl a smile, but when she's running with fire like that, she's generally a little more worried about how to beat her opponent and her own survival to really think about smiling.  Minor detail, but anyone who reads these books will know that she is definitely not smiling during her fights!

As the story unfolds, the pair defeats a homicidal villain known as Scapegrace, who sees his intended killing spree as a form of art. But the victory is short-lived as a new, far more powerful adversary appears on the scene.Baron Vengeous, a terrible baddie from Skulduggery's past, escapes from prison. (In a clever nod to This is Spinal Tap, Skulduggery notes that on the villain scale of one to ten, Vengeous \"turns it all the way up to eleven.\") The Baron, much like Serpine from the first book, is on a mission to revive the Faceless Ones from the dead. His plan involves summoning a beast known as the Grotesquery, a Frankenstein-like hodgepodge of body bits. With the Grostequery and the magical armor of the powerful necromancer Lord Vile, nothing can stand in the Baron's way. Except, perhaps, the fire-flinging Valkyrie and her dead mentor.In their quest to stop the Baron, the pair encounter Springheeled Jack, a creature who strikes fear into the hearts of Londoners at night and an infected assassin called Billy-Ray Sanguine. The lightning-fast story offers plenty of twists and a touch of paranoia as Valkyrie and Skulduggery come to understand that there's far more to this plot than they originally imagined.Fans of Landy's initial outing will be very pleased with the second book, which, I'm happy to say, is even funnier than the first. Landy has a talent for the snappy banter between Valkyrie and Skulduggery, perfectly framing their relationship as both friends and teacher/student. Valkyrie is settling in to her role as a descendent of the Ancients who can control elements. It's fun to watch her grow more confident in her abilities but, at the same time, acknowledge that she still relies on Skulduggery's knowledge and assistance. Although the story moves along briskly, Landy manages to breathe life into all his characters and allow them to grow as events unfold.Realizing that there was a higher force controlling the Baron, the book ends on a pleasantly ominous note: \"Bad things are coming for us, Valkyrie.\" Bad things for Valkyrie and Pleasant perhaps, but only great things for readers, who will be eagerly awaiting the next book in this increasingly entertaining series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Readers will be eagerly awaiting the next book in this increasingly entertaining series", "unixReviewTime": 1277078400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2010"}

Stephanie is officially apprenticed to Skulduggery Pleasant, learning more elemental magic, and helping Skulduggery fight crime under her taken name, Valkyrie Cain. Throughout the novel, it was impressive to see how deftly Landy handled the unusual name change of his main character as well as her negotiation of people who know her as both Valkyrie and Stephanie.Skulduggery and Valkyrie are dealing with the usual mayhem and misfits when news of something really unpleasant comes their way. Baron Vengeous, one of Skulduggery's old enemies, is back in town and dead set on bringing a monster called the Grotesquery back to life to wreak some havoc. Cobbled together from pieces of the most feared, not to mention brutal, monsters ever seen the Grotesquery has to be stopped before it becomes invincible. Oh and before it calls the Faceless Ones back to Earth to destroy everything.With the help of Tanith Low, the two detectives set out to find and destroy the Grotesquery. But, as often happens, complications get in the way. In addition to possible corruption in the Council of Elders, Valkyrie and Skulduggery have to deal with Billy-Ray Sanguine--simultaneously one of the most likable and most horrifying villains of the series thus far.On top of that, Valkyrie is beginning to feel like a stranger in her normal life as Stephanie Edgley. Using an enchanted reflection to go to school and otherwise act as her proxy, Valkyrie keeps telling herself that is the price for a life of adventure and magic. Still, as the problems mount and Valkyrie finds more twists and danger, it starts to seem like there will be a higher price to pay.The important thing to remember about this series is that Skulduggery Pleasant was an insanely awesome, utterly original book. Given the high bar set by its predecessor, it was perhaps unavoidable that Playing with Fire would not be as good.There is an old adage that before leaving the house a person should take off one accessory; if this book were a person, it would instead add one more. Landy piles villains on top of villains so that names begin to blend together and necessitate rereading. This novel is also rife with battle scenes--too many, really, in relation to the plot. Finally, and this one can be fixed, the end of the book left a lot of questions unanswered.Taken together, these things lead to the possibility that Playing with Fire is a bridge book which serves more to transition from the first book and pave the way for the third book in the series than to stand on its own. (Clarifying example: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was a bridge movie.) Thus, while much of this book was not as marvelous as the first it is still entirely possible and even likely that the third book The Faceless Ones (due out in August 2009) will be another powerhouse of a book.The emblematic banter and humor were still present, but not often enough. Ironically, given the name of the series, Skulduggery Pleasant really did not have enough page time in this book.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "from missprint DOT wordpress DOT com", "unixReviewTime": 1241827200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2009"}

Aided by the vampire Dusk and razor-blade wielding U.S. import Billy-Ray Sanguine, Vengeous plans to complete a mission Lord Vile set in motion years ago.With the help of China Sorrows and Tanith Low, Skulduggery and Valkyrie must put together the various pieces of the Baron's plot before he resurrects the Grotesquery (a monster assembled from the most fearsome beasts of legend) and brings the Faceless Ones back to life.PLAYING WITH FIRE is a swiftly paced novel that delivers adventure and suspense without sacrificing character and relationship development. The relationships between Valkyrie and her mentors have deepened in this second novel, yet we also see a distance being created from her family and old life.Readers will be satisfied with the novel's plot wrap-up, yet still hunger for the next installment thanks to Derek Landy's overarching hints and teases of a much larger conspiracy.

Tolkien fairy tales on audio book! I feel like I am back in my childhood with my mother reading to me. The difference in this audio book however, is that there are different voices for characters and background sounds and music, thus making it more of a production than just a normal audio book read. The stories are enchanting, while intelligent of course, and it is so good to hear more from a master storyteller like Tolkien. I was not familiar with any of them so each one is a treat.  I do think I will even share some of them with my reading students in middle school!One of the \"stories\" actually contains a couple of long poems as well as some others and I enjoyed them very much. It was a nice change of pace in THE ADVENTURES OF TOM BOMBADIL. I think this one can be listened to many times to get more out of each poem as you listen again and again.  I think \"The Shadow Bride\" can be discussed more than the others, as it seems to have a deeper, not so light, feel to it.FARMER GILES OF HAM would be the story I would most like my students to listen to. It is light and has a grand, although not so willing, hero. It has the requisite dragon and brave knights who should slay him in ordinary tales, but in Tolkein we don't look for ordinary. Here we find a chubby farmer who seems to be the only one who can do battle with the dragon. There is also a talking dog that the students would enjoy.  It is charming and funny and one people of all ages would enjoy.LEAF BY NIGGLE is a tale with a much deeper meaning to it. The memorable presentation brings life and death into it in subtle ways, which make for a second listening, or third, to try and see what Tolkein really meant by the subtle use of symbolism in the tale. All of this in what in simpler terms might just be about an artist who is painting a picture of a tree.Finally, SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR delightfully tells about a special gift to a not so special person and what this gift does for him. I think this might have been my favorite but then again, each time I listen to the wonderfully written words of Tolkein, I find more in the stories to like and change my mind again.

R. R. Tolkien, had written more.  (I long since tried the Silmarilion, but it seemed to be made for another race of readers.) How pleasant, then, to happen upon this book in the library.Roverandom is a dreamy story about a dog who goes to the moon and under the sea.  Told originally to Tolkien's children, I felt it was softer, less polished, in fact very nice to read to a child who likes dogs. (But I repeat myself.)Farmer Giles of Ham was for me a delightful story.  The cowardly, boastful talking dog is alone almost worth the price of the book . . . I found myself reading part of that story to my boys, though they are well past th age of being read to, or have not yet reached it again.  Funny and delightful, including Tolkien's faux-scholarly introduction.I didn't read Tom Bombadil; sorry, I had enough of him in the Fellowship of the Ring.  I did read the intro, which was mildly amusing, more false scholarship of the kind that Tolkien and Lewis and friends liked to engage in in their letters.Smith of Wooton Major is again quite good, about an obscure fellow who likes to go to Fairyland, and his adventures in the \"real world.\"  If this really is autobiographical, that makes it especially touching; one almost wants to read allegory in at points, but refuse, in respect for Tolkien's feelings about the matter.Leaf by Niggle touched me.  Tolkien expresses what life is about, how little of what we dream of comes true, what is real and what seems real, and the hope he had that more would come of our paltry works than we now dream.  It reminds one of Thomas Aquinas' statement that his great work was only so much straw; and yet, knowing how Tolkien loved trees, it is a more positive statement than that.On Fairy-stories is much the most difficult read in the book, but well worth reading.  Here is a great story-teller and scholar's philosophy of imagination.  He interacts with other great story-tellers, like Lang, Grimm, Chesterton (a major influence, I think) and Shakespeare (he had his criticisms!), and offers a fascinating theory of fantasy, \"sub-creation,\" and the work of God in this world.  This essay is ultimately a theology or Christian map of reality as well as a theory of fairy tales.  Having written a couple books on how the Gospel fulfills truths in other cultures, I find his thoughts deeply significant for themselves, as well as for their influence on C. S. Lewis.You don't have to read each of these pieces, of course; but it's so good to hear from this old friend, again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good to hear from an old friend!", "unixReviewTime": 1272067200, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2010"}

While my personal preference is to read -- rather than watch or listen to -- Tolkien's work, these shorter pieces are better adapted to the radio play form than the voluminous and sometimes consciousness-straining BBC version of The Lord of the Rings -- an audio file recommended only to those with an a-prior and crystal-clear comprehension of that work.Perhaps the greatest kindness here -- in addition to putting \"Leaf by Niggle\" within easy reach of those only casually familiar with Tolkien's body of work -- is a very approachable approach to the complicated and often daunting \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\". Bombadil is, of course, one of the more famously difficult to interpret characters in Middle Earth, viewed by critics as everything from a bumpkin-like distraction to a profoundly fundamental and elemental force of nature. The focus here is perhaps more on the passages dealing with Mr. Bombadil within The Lord of the Rings than with the epically long poem, so there still remains an agreeable measure of \"daunting\" to be dealt with.It's heartening to see these stories take their turn as the film craze both calms and gets set to rebuild.

Sapiens \"Amanda\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This review is for the 3 CD audiobook version of Tales from the Perilous Realm, which includes Tom Bombadil (running time 54:52), Farmer Giles of Ham (54:53), Smith of Wootten Major (33:1), and Leaf by Niggle (34:28). Tom Bombadil is a must for any LoTR fan, while the lesser known allegorical works are no less than Tolkien's finest. Aside from Tom Bombadil, these are not Middle Earth stories, but rather Great Britain mythology from the time of kings, dragons, and fairies.Packaging/Presentation: I was disappointed with the packaging - there is a plastic spacer inside, and the CD's are in cardboard CD envelopes. For long-term usage and gift presentation, I would have preferred something a little slicker, more durable, and without a spacer. A little information on the stories would have been nice (written in...). Petty, I know.Quality/Performance: I have several audiobooks - and am well-used to straight narration (as in someone reading me the book). That is absolutely not what you get here. Rather, it is a true performance. With several different male and female speakers. They adopt middle earth accents and at one point, even a dog accent (it'll make more sense upon listening). Sound effects are plentiful, horse sounds, clanging keys, bells tolling, intro music - and surround sound is incorporated well.While entertaining, there is one caveat I would like to mention. As these stories are performed, you don't get \"And then Pip said...\" so at some points I was a little confused as to who was saying what. This was most evident during Tom Bombadil. At times, I also had difficulty understanding them when they were speaking from far off - this was a problem in the car, but less so with headphones.The Adventures of Tom Bombadil: Originally published as a series of several poems, the first poem is included in this audiobook. This story's purpose is to shed light on the mysterious Tom Bombadil and his wife, Goldberry. We know from LoTR that Tom was here before even the elves came and that gave aide to Frodo during the first book, but little else. In this work, the poems are amassed in story form. It picks up where Tom meets Frodo at Old Man Willow's tree and tells that story in depth. In addition, while staying with Tom, we learn more about how he came to be and what his role in Middle Earth is (although this is a subject of great debate). At times, the story will jump around from what seems like story to story - this is the nature of it being a series of poems I suppose. However, it is easy to follow and superbly performed. I felt as if I were listening to the audio of a movie. LoTR fans will enjoy this reading; however I do recommend the entire work, which is almost a history of Middle Earth told in folkloric fashion. If you happen not to have liked LoTR (blasphemy!), you likely will not appreciate this story as it does pick up in the middle of Fellowship of the Ring.Farmer Giles of Ham: Farmer Giles holds himself to be a most-distinguished person in the town Ham, but is really rather unimportant until he stumbles into heroics. Later, again by chance, he is sent on a quest to kill the dragon Chrysophylax and steal his fortune for the king. However, along the way, Giles outwits the dragon, tames him, and rises to greatness himself. The story may seem juvenile as his dog plays a large speaking role. Of all the stories, this one was not my favorite - but I like stories that make you think.Smith of Wootton Major: This story brings you straight into the Realm of Faery. In the village of Wootton Major, a great cake hiding a number of trinkets is made for the village children. The blacksmith's son happens upon a star (which he swallows) that later leads him to the Faery Realm. In this story, people are not always who they appear to be and should not be judged by their apparent station. This story also touches on themes of communal responsibility and the passing on of gifts. Younger listeners will enjoy this one and older listeners may appreciate the allegory.Leaf by Niggle: This was my clear favorite of the stories. Very allegorical, Leaf by Niggle tells the story of a humble painter, his relationship with his ailing neighbors, and his responsibility to the community. I believe this story also deals with profound questions regarding life, humanity, and heaven (but I could be reading into it too much). In any event, I appreciate the insights into Tolkien's greater philosophies of life presented in this story. Even if you take it at face value with no greater depth, it is a charming tale.Summary: Get this audiobook if you enjoy Tolkien's writing style, which is dense, allegorical, and fanciful.

But it is aimed at the new reader of these works - it is a guide to how to read them, not ground-breaking new scholarship.I am personally not a fan of realism in illustration of Tolkien's works; I find that a more stylized approach better suits the atmosphere of his writing.  This is perhaps purely a matter of personal taste, but I can't read the stories included in this collection without a deep longing for the original illustrations by Pauline Baynes - particularly for Farmer Giles, where Tolkien himself said he felt her artwork reduced his text to a commentary on the drawings. To my mind, Lee's pale, washed-out pencil drawings hardly hold a candle to Baynes' ability to convey the humor, enchantment, and melancholy of Tolkien's shorter works.All of the included works by Tolkien are readily available elsewhere. Roverandom, Farmer Giles, Smith, and On Fairy-stories have recently appeared in excellent stand-alone editions with critical commentary and, when applicable, the original illustrations by Baynes or Tolkien himself. All but Roverandom and Smith are included in The Tolkien Reader, which is still in print, though alas only in paperback; I imagine this collection is meant to replace it in hardback.If you are a fan of Alan Lee, the answer may be yes, though for most of the tales there are actually only two drawings each. But for the scholar or serious reader of Tolkien, the individual volumes with commentary are a wiser expenditure, and have the advantage of including corrected texts (I did not go through the texts in this volume with a fine-tooth comb, but I did spot at least one punctuation error). Is it a good introduction for the new reader of Tolkien, looking to read something beyond The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings? Perhaps; it gathers the most important texts conveniently in one place, but the Baynes illustrations (and Tolkien's own illustrations for Roverandom) add so much to the experience that I would hate to see the first-time reader miss them. I'm afraid Tales from the Perilous Realm won't be on any of my gift-giving lists.Here are the items I recommend instead for the serious Tolkien reader:RoverandomFarmer Giles of Ham : The Rise and Wonderful Adventures of Farmer Giles, Lord of Tame, Count of Worminghall, and King of the Little KingdomTolkien on Fairy-StoriesSmith of Wootton MajorThe Tolkien Reader", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "There are better options for the serious Tolkien reader", "unixReviewTime": 1232582400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2009"}

The other four are \"Leaf By Niggle\", a short tale with deeply moving theological connotations which originally accompanied the Fairy Stories lecture; \"Roverandom\", a story written by Tolkien to comfort one of his sons who had lost a toy dog while at the seashore and not published until 25 years after the author died; \"Farmer Giles of Ham,\" a rollicking tale set in early Britain featuring a bumbling farmer, a near sighted giant, and a dragon which was originally published in the late 1940s;  \"Smith of Wooton Major\", a beautiful story published in the 1960s which is usually interpreted as being Tolkien's acknowledgment that his life was coming to a close and his gifts must be returned or passed on to others.All of these stories have been published before in different formats, and I have loved them all for many years.

A no-nonsense man was Farmer Giles, and when someone steps onto his property, he is there to meet him with his blunderbuss. However, when the next person to set foot on his property is a giant, Farmer Giles soon finds himself dealing with kings and knights and legendary swords and, worst of all, dragons!2) Smith of Wootton Major tells the story of a little town that has a wonderful tradition where a special cake is baked every twenty four years, and eaten by twenty four good children. But, when a magical Faery star is slipped into this year&#8217;s cake, it is eaten by the local smith&#8217;s son. And so the life of the younger smith is changed beyond anyone&#8217;s imagination &#8211; he is marked by beauty of face and voice, and (unbeknownst to anyone) he can even visit the land of Faery whenever he likes. It is a life of magic and giving.3) Leaf by Niggle is actually my favorite, telling the story of Niggle, a man with an artist&#8217;s soul, who lives in a society that does not value art. He does what he can, when he can, but soon he must go on a trip that he was not prepared for. But, on the far side of this journey is the true art and beauty that he only glimpsed before.4) The Adventures of Tom Bombadil is an extract of the story of the hobbit&#8217;s meeting with the magical Tom Bombadil and his true love, Goldberry, the Daughter of the River, taken from The Lord of the Rings.5) And finally, Roverandom, which tells the story of a young dog named Rover, who crosses a powerful wizard from Persia. (The wizard, named Artaxerxes, had become lost and asked for directions, the misguided guide was confused and given him directions to Pershore instead!) Artaxerxes turns Rover into a toy dog, and sends him off. This is the start of an epic quest for Rover, who meets a sand-wizard, the Man-in-the-Moon, the great dragons that live on the moon, the many merfolk living at the bottom of the ocean, and a delightful little boy.Overall, I found this to be a charming and delightful collection of stories.

Sharing is what gets Smith his wife, his success in life, and eventually, the opportunity to give another deserving person the chance for such success.\"Leaf by Niggle\" is a warning about what can come from literally not seeing the forest for the trees (or even not seeing the tree for the leaves).  Sometimes people are so wrapped up in the details of their own lives they forget the greater world.  In this case, there is a chance for redemption because Niggle was basically a good person.

I would be a little hesitant at listening to it with children as it involves an obsessive-compulsive painter who is sent to some type of mental institution, yet later is released and gives free reign to his imagination.Finally, The Adventures Of Tom Bombadil is a side adventure of Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, on their quest to destroy the Ring (from the Lord Of The Rings).

I liked the different voices and sound effects. There are times during the audio that I found the background music to be shrill to the point of drowning out the dialogue; I had to continuously adjust the volume of my car stereo to compensate for the differences between music and voices. However, these remain charming little stories in a creative presentation.I especially enjoyed \"Smith of Wootton Major.\" This is an engaging little tale of fantasy, faith, creativity, and simple goodness. I thought that the dramatization here was quite effective, and I could easily listen to this story alone over and over. It was also a treat to listen to \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" - I think any Tolkein fan will be happy to have additional doses of Bombadil, and this collection doesn't disappoint.\"Farmer Giles of Ham\" is a sweet, humorous little story that reminds me of so many of the fairy tales I read as a child.For me, the weakest entry here is \"Leaf by Niggle.\" I actually nearly skipped over this story because I found the narrative to be so tedious. I get the message of the piece, but I think a little less being hit over the head by the message would have been more effective.Although I like this audio version, I think being able to hold these stories and see illustrations would probably be a better way to absorb them.

The results were pleasantly surprising. The stories are told in a very interesting manner, with various sound effects and actors playing their parts to perfection.

Those who have watched the movies only, would not know this character. Tom is the \"Master\", he is much above the Ring, the dark lord, the elves, the forest or any beings. This wonderful character is given great place in the actual book, but not in the movie.

These have touches of what would in future lead to ideas like the \"One\" you cannot resist, fairies, realms, towns folk and the usual Tolkien fare.

Although I am an avid reader & a fan of Tolkien, my experience is limited to The Hobbit, LOTR, & The Silmarillion.  I have been wanting to read his short stories and other works, so I jumped at this volume, when I saw it.I will not bother with summaries of the stories, since that has been done in other revies.  I will focus on the production quality.Disc 1 contains the Farmer Giles tale.  This story is entertaining & suitable for all ages.  The voices seem to be well-cast & the sound effects were believable.Disc 2 contains Smith Of Wootton Major, an interesting story with a hint of magic & mystery.  This is also suitable for all ages.  The voices, again were enjoyable & well done.Also on disc 2 is Leaf By Niggle.  I think children would have trouble understanding this story & there may be content that's not appropriate for them, anyway.Disc 3 features The Adventures Of Tom Bombadil, a title which was somewhat misleading, at least for me.  I was hoping for & expecting a little history or backstory on the interesting character of Tom Bombadil.  This production is not really about Tom, at all, it merely recounts the chapters in The Fellowship Of The Ring where the Hobbits meet Tom Bombadil & their experiences with him.  Having read this story before, I had some preconcieved ideas about the voices of Tom & his wife & did not care for their portrayal in this volume.  The voices of the hobbits were well-done, however.Overall, the dramatizations were well-done.  The 3 discs come packaged in a box.  The front of the box is pictured on the product page & the back contains a summary of each story with a very small list of credits.  I would like to see a booklet added to the packaging that includes the cast list for each story & perhaps a \"chapter list\" to make skipping ahead a little easier, when necessary.

{"reviewerID": "A4FX5YCJA630V", "asin": "0007257546", "reviewerName": "R. M. Fisher \"Ravenya\"", "helpful": [13, 13], "reviewText": "There is a passage in one of the stories collected here that accurately sums up the content of the book itself. In \"Leaf By Niggle,\" Tolkien describes a painting that the artist Niggle has been working on: \"It had begun with a leaf caught in the wind, and it became a tree; and the tree grew, sending out innumerable branches, and thrusting out the most fantastic roots...Niggle lost interest in his other pictures; or else he took them and tacked them on to the edges of his great picture. Soon the canvas became so large that he had to get a ladder, and he ran up and down it, putting in a touch here, and rubbing out a patch there.\"If the great tree on the canvas is Tolkien's master-work,The Lord of the Rings, then the other little pictures that are \"tacked on\" to the edges of the bigger one are the stories that are contained within \"Tales from the Perilous Realms.\" Although they are written in the same style and often contain the same themes as the famous trilogy, they are not directly related to Middle-Earth itself. Instead they are self-contained short stories that shed further light on Tolkien's ideas concerning the importance of fairytales, or more specifically, his love of Faerie (not the species, but the place) as a setting for adventures.Contained here are four short stories, a collection of poems and an essay that explore Tolkien's work outside \"The Lord of the Rings,\" supplemented by illustrations by Alan Lee. Although older editions of the stories were illustrated by Pauline Baynes (better known as the illustrator for C.S. Lewis'sThe Chronicles of Narnia), Lee's art is not just an acceptable exchange, but somehow even more fitting. Thanks to his work on Peter Jackson's film adaptations of Tolkien's work, Alan Lee (along with John Howe) has come to be affiliated with Tolkien's work in the same way that we link Quentin Blake with Roald Dahl and John Tenniel with Lewis Carroll, and his beautiful pencil sketches (or watercolours, depending on what version you get) manage to capture the text's blend of whimsy and realism.The story of \"Roverandom\" was born out of Tolkien's desire to comfort one of his sons after the boy's favourite toy dog went missing on a holiday to the seashore. Tolkien speculates that the toy was not a toy at all, but rather a real dog that had been transformed by a grumpy wizard, and who was now attempting to find his way home again. Journeying from the moon to the depths of the ocean, and meeting a host of magical creatures on the way, Roverandom's various adventures contain aspects of the ancient mythology that Tolkien admired so much. As the introduction by Tom Shippey points out, the dragons, serpents and wizards in the story all have their counterparts in later works; it is all \"connected with the bigger picture.\"\"Farmer Giles of Ham\" is distinctive due to its narrative voice, in which an imaginary editor translates an imaginary narrator, wherein the editor is more interested in the tale's scholarly value on historical place names. With a rather disdainful tone of voice, the editor is ultimately undermined by the spirit of the story itself, which pits a hapless farmer against a wily dragon, entirely against his will. Sound vaguely familiar? Clearer than in any other story we can glimpse Tolkien's love of hearth and home, and the supremacy of simple pleasures and old traditions.Midway through the book is a segment titled \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,\" named after one of sixteen poems included here, some of which were included in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and only two of which involve Tom Bombadil himself. As most readers already know, Tom Bombadil appears within the trilogy as one of its most mysterious characters, most widely regarded as a sort of embodiment of the English countryside; someone who is immensely powerful, but not interested in exerting that power. Tolkien's powers of creating mood and melancholy are at work here, particularly with the poignant \"The Last Ship,\" which involves the passing of the Elves from Middle Earth.Tolkien presents these poems as the \"marginalia\" of writing that was found in the Red Book of Westmarch, which most will recall as the book authored by Bilbo, Frodo and Sam at the conclusion of the trilogy, and from which Tolkien himself purported to gather his information on the War of the Ring. It is a clever way of including several of his early poems (many of which were composed before his great trilogy was properly conceived) into the framework of his greater story, and Tolkien even includes a foreword that speculates on which of his characters wrote which poems. This means he has to retcon a couple of details, as when he blames the fake Elvish names in the poem \"Errantry\" (which was written thirty years prior to the trilogy) as Bilbo's poor grasp of the Elvish language, but also provides intriguing details such as speculation that \"The Sea Bell\" was written not by, but in memory of Frodo, regarding to his disturbing illness after returned to the Shire. Needless to say, it all adds to the rich tapestry of \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\"Smith of Wootton Major\" is my favourite story in this collection. Despite its humdrum name, the tale is one of the deep enchantment that comes with passage between this world and \"the Perilous Realms,\" after a lowly smith swallows a star concealed in a celebratory cake. Endowed with the ability to traverse the Faerie world, the story tells of his experiences there, until the time comes for him to pass the gift onto another. Sad and sweet, the story contains themes that permeate Tolkien's other work, such as the diminishing powers of the Elves due to people willingly reducing them to pretty little dolls, stripped of all their potency. Yet, as the Elf Queen says: \"Better a doll, maybe, than no memory of Faery at all.\"As mentioned above, \"Leaf by Niggle\" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the creation of \"Rings\", with Tolkien as the artist Niggle, a man who is desperate to get his life's work finished. Shippey describes it as an \"otherworldly Divine Comedy\", in which Niggle is constantly interrupted, first by his own habits, and then by outside forces, finally enduring a sort of Purgatory, before advancing on into the world beyond the frame of his his own work. Although all the stories so far can easily be read to and by children, this is one that may very well leave them baffled. However, this shouldn't stop anyone from actually reading it to them anyway, though it may take a few reads by adults as well in order to derive the full meaning of Niggle's mysterious journey. Having apparently coming to Tolkien in a dream, this story is one that transcends both our world *and* fantasy realms, taking us past death and into the (possible) afterlife.Finally, the collection is capped off with Tolkien's famous \"On Fairy-Stories\" lecture, which essentially contains much of the ideology behind \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and the blueprint for its themes and plotting. Here is where Tolkien coined terms such as the \"eucatastrophe,\" and \"sub-creations\" and argues the full importance of fairytales in the world: \"we get a piercing glimpse of joy, and heart's desire, that for a moment passes outside the frame, rends indeed the very heart web of story, and lets a gleam come through.\"\"Tales from the Perilous Realm\" will most likely appeal most to Tolkien enthusiasts, particularly in its inclusion of the poems, but anyone with a passing interest in fairytales will most likely appreciate and enjoy this collection. Inevitably there are glimpses and echoes of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" which add depth to Tolkien's later work whether it is read before or after this anthology. If you squint, the star in \"Smith of Wootton Major\" is almost like a benevolent Ring, which grants insight and a certain degree of power; whilst \"Farmer Giles of Ham\" has the warmth and familiarity of the Shire in its portrayal of the English countryside. And when Roverandom gets a glimpse of the Western Isles of the edge of the world, I felt a little shiver, knowing that in another time and place, Frodo would be glimpsing them too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"For Some the Only Glimpse.

As the story plays, you hear great sound effects that transport you into the adventure. The story starts with the farmer's dog, Gaum, discovering a Giant smashing crops and eating livestock as he travels. Farmer Giles falls over and accidentally shoots the Giant. Since he's so big, the Giant just thinks there are biting flies there and meanders in the opposite direction. Of course, rumors spread and the story gets exaggerated to the King who then sends the sword, \"Tailbiter\" to Farmer Giles. (Remember the sword in the Hobbit story?). A dragon then comes to the area burning crops, eating Parsons and \"people of small stature\" and wreaking havoc on the citizens. The Knights are all busy with a tournament, Christmas and then New Years, so it's up to Farmer Giles and \"Tailbiter\" to take care of the dragon. From there it's laughter to the listener.

They move along at a nice pace. They draw upon Tolkein's knowledge of folktales. They have that gentle view of humanity that so charms readers especially in this jaded time of splatterpunk and Grand Theft Auto.However, only two of these stories surpass themselves. Leaf of Nigel is a surprisingly modern story about a painter who is constantly harassed by his neighbors. One finds echoes in the stories of Peretz and O. Henry. Nigel is a painter but never feels like he's good enough to paint. ANd his neighbors constantly come to interrupt him. At the end, it's realized that he was worthy all along. Much of the story feels like an artist talking to himself and telling himself that he is worthwhile, darnit. But it's still rather effect.The other great story in the collection is Farmer of Ham vs. the Dragon. Very much like the Hobbit, this tale invokes the medeival politicking without hitting you over the head (like say Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court might do). Farmer doesn't so much fight a dragon as annoy him but annoy him in such a way that he really can't do anything about it. There's also a dog, but that's a trifle.The fairy story is a bit too predictable. Hate to say that Neil Gaiman did it better, but Neil Gaiman did it better. I suppose Neil Gaiman would have read the story somewhere along the lines and it may have influenced him, but that doesn't change the fact that no one does fairy stories like Neil Gaiman.The last story in the collection probably shouldn't be in the collection at all. Tom Bombadil is an annoying character, written solely to tie LOTR to The Hobbit and even he doesn't do a very good job of it. Bilbo, the ring and Gandalf are all on hand so why use TOm Bombadil?

Those two works combined guaranteed that Tolkien would always have a place at the top of fantasy fiction.  Publishers and film studios know that if you just put Tolkien's name on something, you're guaranteed to have more success than without.  Not long ago, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt became the prime American publisher of \"new\" Tolkien works.  A couple years ago they published THE CHILDREN OF HURIN which was a very successful book and this summer they will be publishing a new edition of Tolkien's translation of THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRUN.  Last fall (2008), this volume TALES FROM THE PERILOUS REALM was released.  The book is a collection of four short stories, a collection of poems, and an essay.  Each of the works is available elsewhere, either as a stand alone volume or a part of larger collection. However, this is the first time that these pieces are together in one book.  The stories share no characters or settings and are only connected because of theme: each one is a fantasy or \"fairy story\".  TALES FROM THE PERILOUS REALM includes:\"Roverandom\"--a story about a toy dog that comes to life, flies to moon, and travels to the depths of the oceans.\"Farmer Giles of Ham\"--a tale about a simple early British farmer who using his wits and common sense defeats a giant and a dragon.\"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\"--this is a collection of poems and the only piece that has any association with Middle Earth.  A few of the poems are about Tom Bombadil, but most are just poems that are a part of the culture that citizens of Earth probably would have been familiar.  Included is the poem about the Oliphants that Samwise talks about in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.\"Smith of Wooton Major\"--a true fairy tale about how deceiving appearances can be and the passing of gifts from one generation to the next.\"Leaf By Niggle\"--an allegorical story about a painter who goes on a long journey.\"On Fairy-Stories\"--Tolkien's essay about what is and isn't true fantasy.The book also includes an introduction by Tom Shippey and the stories are accompanied by illustrations from Alan Lee.TALES FROM THE PERILOUS REALM is a pretty decent collection of Tolkien's shorter works, especially that not connected to Middle Earth (except for \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\").  Those who consider themselves Tolkien scholars might not get as much from this book as a casual Tolkien fan or reader.  The illustrations are nice, but Alan Lee is a different artist than Pauline Bayne and some readers might not like that.

The production values are exceptional.  The acting is always lively and true--even if sometimes the quality of the voices sometimes sounds incongruous with the characters they represent (Should Goldberry sound like a heavy smoker?).  Sound effects are appropriate and never overused.  The music is perhaps more synthesized than any production from the last decade has any right to be, but the story nevertheless benefits from its addition.The adaptations of the stories are, for the most part, quite well done.  I don't know if Tolkien's original tale for \"Farmer Giles\" had a talking dog, but the story is better for the BBC's hilarious portrayal of the pet.  While pacing sometimes seems rushed, and the passage of time often seems to move too quickly, the production is operating as best as it can under the time restraints of modern media.  Having read more than a little of Tolkien in the past, I am assuming that much of the actual dialogue was scripted directly by the BBC, but it all seems to meld seamlessly into the Middle-Earth that so many of us have come to love and appreciate.The tales themselves are respectable additions to the Tolkien canon, all demonstrating the professor's love for nature and Faerie.  \"Farmer Giles of Ham\" is an amusing story about a \"dragon-slayer\"; it is perhaps the most cohesive and accessible of the tales.  \"Smith of Wooton Major\" follows the tradition of many of our most popular fairy tales--the kind of tale where, after reading it, certain aspects of morality still remain ambiguous.  \"Leaf by Niggle\" is the most unique story for its allegorizing of the afterlife (yes, I am aware Tolkien hated allegory) and its study of the artist.  And \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" will offer no surprises for fans of The Lord of the Rings; it is faithfully reproduced here for anyone slighted by its omission from Peter Jackson's films.All in all, these are wonderful adaptations of some great narratives.

There are high points, certainly. Hilary Mantel's prize-winning WOLF HALL is a masterly evocation of Henry's reign, as are the superb historical mysteries by C.J. Sansom. And Philippa Gregory's many novels of the period are colorful, absorbing reads with a satisfyingly authentic feel.If Suzannah Dunn's latest historical novel, her fourth, isn't quite up to those lofty standards, it is an entertainingly frothy gloss on the story of Henry's unlucky fifth wife. THE CONFESSION OF KATHERINE HOWARD's particular distinction is its emphasis on the youthfulness of the queen and her friends (her precise birth date is disputed, but in Dunn's book she is 17 when she marries Henry). Katherine is that recognizable Popular Girl --- there's one in every high school class; I can remember mine with dead accuracy --- whose enigmatic cool and sexual sophistication other girls envy and admire, love and hate. Kat Tilney, the novel's narrator, positively radiates ambivalence. A girl from a solid but hardly aristocratic family, she meets Katherine when both have been farmed out to the Duchess of Norfolk's household to be educated and made marriageable.Kat is a good foil for Katherine. She is much more nave, her rather medieval notions of love (\"A lady could only love one man --- romantically --- at a time\") colliding with her friend's taste for sexual variety. Although she is able initially to resist the Howard girl's seductive powers, ultimately they become close friends (they even fall in love, consecutively, with the same man). When Katherine becomes queen, she appoints Kat as one of her ladies-in-waiting.Dunn makes the dramatically effective decision to start the novel at the point of maximum danger, as Katherine's enemies are gathering. Her premarital sex life is the issue, so the queen's peril leads quite neatly to a series of flashbacks to her girlhood flirtations and bedroom romps. When Francis Dereham --- Katherine's secretary and former boyfriend, and Kat's current swain --- is pulled in for questioning by the king's secretary of state, the wheels of fate begin to turn.We all know how Katherine ended up (hint: it rhymes with wedded); the suspense in THE CONFESSION OF KATHERINE HOWARD lies in which side Kat comes down on. Will she try to protect her boyfriend or remain loyal to her friend and queen? Adolescent girls being what they are, despite the vaunted sisterly values of feminism, there's no telling....And make no mistake: Teenagers, with their inimitable mix of innocence and knowingness, vulnerability and opportunism, are what Dunn's book is all about. She has written an easy-to-read, diverting novel with some attractive prose, particularly when it comes to descriptions of clothes (\"England: firelight and fireblush; wine-dark, winking gemstones and a frost of pearls. Wool as soft as silk, in leaf-green and moss; satins glossy like a midsummer midnight or opalescent like winter sunrise\"). She is assuming, apparently, that girls then, as now, were fashion-mad, and frighteningly frank about sex. My main quibble is that Dunn also assumes that people spoke the same way in Henry VIII's time as they do today. Just a sampling of anachronisms: \"Kidding\"; \"Nice one\"; \"Amazing.\" It's not that her characters have to be uttering doths and forsooths at every turn, but this is a bit much.Historical fidelity isn't its strong point, yet THE CONFESSION OF KATHERINE HOWARD does bring the young queen's poignant story to life. Katherine may not have been a true innocent, but she hardly deserved so cruel a death. As for Kat, the good girl to the queen's wanton diva, I rooted for her and Francis to survive, marry, and have a family.

As I hadn't previously read a lot on Katherine Howard I was very interested in learning more about her brief stay as Queen of England. The Confession of Katherine Howard takes us deep into the world at court where treachery, lies and betrayals run rampant.At the young age of twelve, Katherine is sent to live with the Duchess of Norfolk. She comes across as aloof to the other girls yet they all want to befriend her. At first Cat Tilney resists Katherine's pull but even she succumbs and they become best friends. Cat is horrified at much of Katherine's behavior because even as a young girl Katherine had a real hankering for the boys. While with the Duchess, Katherine makes her way through a few boys, one being Francis Dereham. She seemed to be quite taken with him but ultimately was called away to King Henry's court at the age of seventeen. I'm not entirely sure that Katherine ever really loved anyone as much as she loved herself.In the meantime Cat is left at the Duchess's and becomes involved with Francis herself. Later on when Katherine is made Queen, Cat is called to court as is Francis. Katherine however has not been idle and certainly not devoted to King Henry. Again Cat is horrified when she learns that Katherine has been carrying on an illicit affair with Thomas Culpeper. Cat warns her that she is going to be found out and that it would mean certain death if she was. Queen's were supposed to be virgins which Katherine was most definitely not. In a time when Queens seemed to be coming and going, Katherine was really playing with fire.Ultimately her background is looked into and it is believed she was pre-contracted to Francis Dereham which back in that day was like a marriage contract. Not being a virgin was alone enough reason for her not being worthy of the King but lying to him as well was treason in its highest form. In the meantime Cat, desperate to help Francis who she loves, gives away a few clues as to more of Katherine's behavior and this is what eventually is the last straw for Katherine. While Katherine does try her best to get herself out of trouble and especially out of being executed, she doesn't succeed.Overall I really enjoyed this book. It's written in a simple and straight forward way that I really liked and it made for easy reading. My biggest complaint about this novel is that I thought, from the title, The Confession of Katherine Howard and even the description of the book, that I would be reading an account from Katherine's viewpoint. The book is told entirely from Cat's viewpoint and really I learned just as much about Cat's life as I did Katherine's. This did take away from the book for me because really it was just Katherine I wanted to read about, not her friend.

You could think this book is told from Katherine's point of view but it's told from Cat's pov the whole time.I think I liked this best from the books I've read from this author. It was rather quick read and while the little too modern writing with \"could've\", should've  and the like. I'm also not sure if they would have said that  \"What goes up must come down\".Katherine is usually described like she has no brains whatsoever so it was refreshing to read this version of her, even if she wasn't very likeable person. It gave the feeling she was too self-centered and didn't love anyone else besides herself.All in all it was enjoyable and rather quick read. But you will most likely learn more about Cat Tilney than Katherine Howard.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Confession of Katherine Howard", "unixReviewTime": 1345852800, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2012"}

But she was NOT the pathologically selfish schemer that Dunn paints her as and various other books and films have done.At any rate its time we dropped the portrayal of sexually adventurous girls as being wicked and deserving a nasty fate while men who do the same are seen as much admired and many rakes.

They remain close through their teen years as their families ignore them.  Katherine falls in love with Francis Dereham.  However, King Henry VIII makes the teenager his fifth wife.  However, her time as queen is short because of accusations that she had an arrangement with Dereham prior to marrying the king; her best friend, a lady in waiting, is also considered for execution due to guilt by association.The Confession of Katherine Howard is made fresh by Catherine, as the narrator Tilney provides a unique perspective that in many ways turns the exciting story line into her tale as she paints a picture of her friend as being intelligent rather than an inane flirt.  In order for Howard to have achieved what she did in a man's world where she was abandoned as a child, she would have needed some smarts.  Ironically what beheaded her was her childhood attraction to Francis Dereham, which no evidence supported the contention that this continued as an adult but was used as if it was alive during her marriage to the king.  Although the wives of Henry have been featured in many biographical fictions including by Suzannah Dunn (see The Queen of Subtleties, The Sixth Wife and The Queen's Sorrow; and The King's Rose by Alissa Libby), this is a unique look at a woman unfairly judged during her life and since; perhaps Henry in his gut knew as he aged rapidly after her beheading.Harriet Klausner", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "fresh biographical fiction", "unixReviewTime": 1302048000, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2011"}

It was a fast read for me, as I became so completely one with the story, that I found it impossible to put down. Suzannah Dunn has the ability to take a fiction novel and pen it a way that is real to the reader. It becomes a fascinating reality to the person holding the book. The characters aren't characters; they are real. The plot isn't a plot; it's actuality. That is, as I said, simply amazing.Katherine's story is vibrant and full of so many emotions. From happiness, to hurt, to anger and love. As a young orphan, Katherine's story is full of ups and downs. She meets her best friend, and  finds a love with Francis that she thought would be true, yet she can no longer hold that love true, but has to leave it behind. She becomes Henry VIII's 5th wife, and takes on that new life of being a queen. But, then rumors fly and things happen to cause her concern about her safety and her standing. What will happen if the truth about Francis, her young lover? Will he be executed so she can live? Will the truth be set free through Katherine's friend, Cat? And what of Katherine's life....is it over before it truly begins?This is a story of love, hope, and betrayal. A powerful novel of an era long forgotten. It's filled with mystery, as the rumors fly, it's suspenseful grip on the reader is tight. The research that Suzannah Dunn did in order to create this historical, fascinating and wonderful novel is beyond fantastic. The emotions she set forth in this book, and the actions of not only Katherine Howard, but also in Francis, Henry VIII and Cat, is all consuming.I highly recommend this novel to everyone who loves the era gone by.

Either she was a silly little girl who got led out of her depth, or she was a knowing, sexual girl - a sort of Tudor Ladette if you like. The former approach is more usually taken by the history books, but with some foundation, Dunn takes the latter view. I don't have an issue with that. Neither do I particularly object to the modern language used - in fact I think it can help to bring these lives to life in a fun way - the use of nicknames for the servants is mildly amusing. This is much like the BBC's Tudors TV series, but without all the heaving bosoms.But the problem with this book, which combines the final days of Katherine's position as Henry VIII's fifth wife with flashbacks of her upbringing, is that it's told from the point of view of Catheryn Tilney (a real life member of Katherine's household) although the depth of friendship and Catheryn's relationship with Dereham is Dunn's own creation. And, as if to emphasise the shift away from seeing Katherine as a silly little girl, here Dunn makes Tilney so desperately dull and nave that the bulk of the book, instead of being about Katherine, is a poor romance of Tilney's sexual navity and her wondering about sex.Given that what we know about Katherine is so richly lurid (her relationships with music teacher Manox and Dereham prior to her wedding and then, while married, with Culpeper) due to the investigation that took place, it's a heck of an achievement to make this such a dull read. Perhaps there is just too much known about this aspect of her life (but little else of it) to excite Dunn's imaginative juices. So she concentrates on her fictionally enhanced Tilney - who is a crashing bore and a drip of the highest order.Dunn invents a friendship that is unbelievable because she paints the two girls as so different - Tilney is bemused how people manage to breath while kissing while Katherine (or Kate as she's known) is spouting wisdom on contraception apparently picked up from her older half sister Isabel Leigh, telling Tilney at one point \"well anyway, Izzy says it's either the lemon or you let them do it up your backside\".I didn't find either brought the characters to life. I was expecting historical fiction - what I got was historical romance - with not that much about the person in the title. I'm sure there's a market for that - I'm just not it.

He summed himself up very well when he makes the comment that the house sent out a message to the world of where he and his family were at......in other words - \"this is a big important house and we are big and important too.....world take note\".Does he really feel that insecure that he needs some sort of symbol of wealth to help him along life's way?

Diagnosed with autism at 2, Conor's speech remains negligible and he is inordinately attached to a stuffed cat. He also insists on coming equipped with wirelike attachments fastened around his waist. His sister Morgana, 6 appears to have some understanding of Conor's cryptic form of communicating.James is equally nonplussed by Conor's mother, Laura Deighton. A renknowned author, Laura is initially described as distant, but proves to be anything but. Her marriage is at an unstable point, although the husband Alan, takes an active part in the childrens' lives.Conor approaches treatment as cautiously as he appears to approach life in general. He uses his stuffed cat as a \"scanner\" and often talks through it. Clearly bright, Conor reads labels and correctly identifies each object in the playroom. He expresses his fears which center around a \"ghost man\" under his rug; death and finding trees on the moon. He identifies this place as \"terria,\" which has the Latin root for \"earth.\" It makes readers wonder if it is the world in general the boy finds frightening.Over time, James learns more about Conor's cryptic view of the world. On an eerie note, Conor's mother reveals a paracosm she created as a child. Her paracosm, or \"parallel fantasy world\" was quite involved with highly developed characters; language and society. The era in which her paracosm, or \"parallel world\" is set appears to be a pre-Christian era or possibly the early 1000s, the days of Viking raids.

He, his two children, Becky, 8 and Mikey 4-5, become involved with Laura and her family.

This is the second installment of Stephen Hunt's slam bam steampunk/adventure series, and now I can't wait forThe Rise of the Iron Moon's American release.The novels are character-driven adventures set in an imaginary world whose center is the nation of Jackals, a nation not unlike England. Because this is steampunk, Jackals is a coal-driven quasi-Charles Dickens era society of floating airships and gas lamps--a modern, but not too modern, society. The heroes are at once likeable and sympathetic, be they children with hidden bloodlines or strong men with anvils for hands or eccentric mechanical steammen or orphans with exoskeletons. Both novels are set in motion almost immediately--in the manner of an Indiana Jones movie--and what follows is a rich mixture of political intrigue, dark magic, and reprehensible rogues.  There is almost no down time in either book--they propel themselves with the force of a steamroller until the final pages.If there are any complaints leveled at Hunt's works, it's that he can be VERY ambitious.  I thought that the climax of his first book,The Court of the Airwas maybe too big, too spectacular. It had as many plot threads as a Tom Clancy novel, and when you marry that with a whole new planet of cultures, characters, and conflicts, it can and did get pretty hairy.  But \"The Kingdom Beyond the Waves\" is much tighter, from start to finish. There is no shortage of action...it's rare to have a dozen pages slip by without a big revelation or a reversal of fortune, but the story is always gripping and credible--a heady task, given that earth quake-like forces can propel whole cities into the upper atmosphere:  three-eyed reptiles can talk and fly; and...well, you get the picture.In short: disgraced professor Amelia Harsh has just about given up on her father's quest--finding the ancient lost civilization of Camlantis--when a rich benefactor appears: Abraham Quest, the man who drove her father to ruin. As her options are limited, she gathers a crew composed of convicted slave traders and steroidally enhanced female soldiers and they board a refitted u-boat to sneak up the Shedarkshe river into the Daggish territory, a brutal jungle where all intruders run the risk of being forcibly assimilated into an animal-plant hive called the Greenmesh. On the way she must deal with a saboteur, a mutinous crew, and a growing awareness that secrets have been kept from her, and the true purpose of her expedition will not only endanger her life, but the lives and destiny of her entire world.If you can't tell, Hunt's imagination is almost limitless, and there is no end of intrigue and plot twists throughout. And it's FUN to read...in fact, I had to keep telling myself to slow down, to savor. I like how he spreads it around, too: his female characters are every bit the equal of the males, and it is a mark of a gifted writer that even mechanical men are gIven as much personality and backstory as the flesh-and-blood ones. And this, I think, is Hunt's greatest strength: he has created a world that, two novels in, shows no signs of diminishment. He has so much going on in his first two novels that what I understand might be a six-book series seems entirely possible.A note: while \"The Kingdom Beyond the Waves\" is a stand-alone novel, it helps to have readThe Court of the Airbeforehand. I love these books so much that I'm actually constructing a glossary of the unusual terms and phrases that might help readers a bit--it's about the only thing I thought was missing from these big, wonderful  books...and I'd be happy to share it with anyone who wants it, or would like to contribute to it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this book!", "unixReviewTime": 1255305600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2009"}

Perron \"Philip\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I saw this book and figured it would be a good thing to read since steampunk seems to be a very neat genre and this one was not too short (550+ pages) and had a pretty cool Victorian feel to its book jacket.  So I picked it up and started it pretty soon after.The author creates a really unique world.  His writing is pretty interesting in which he mentions things in passing or in the immediate conversation as if you, the reader, know these things already and as a result you learn things about the novel's world really nicely without sad and boring exposition.  It is really a great way of writing and that made me enjoy the novel even more so.  And to do this successfully, as the author has, is amazing since the world he creates is truly a sci-fi/fantasy world that is completely unfamiliar to the reader.The story is about a woman professor named Amelia from a nation named Jackals in a steampunk world (Victorian era atmosphere (think of Jules Vernes) with an alternate history-like technology (steammen, airships, Capt. Nemo submarines, etc.)) who is hired by her deceased father's rival, a brilliant scientist/business man named Quest, to find the lost city of Camlantis, what is believed to be a utopian society of peace and prosperity for all.  The city is known to have been lost to a self-inflicted floatquake (an earthquake but the land is sent to float in the clouds rather than necessarily destroyed).  Various artifacts have been found (books that are actually hard drives) showing things of wonder about Camlantis just fuel the urge of the folks to find it.  In the world that Amelia lives in having various wars between nations and the normal problems we have today (wars, hunger, disease, terrorism, etc.), Amelia and Quest (it seems) wants to see if the technology and philosophy of Camlantis (if found) would be able to solve all the world's problems.  So Quest puts together a group including Amazon like women warriors as defense, ex-slavers as seamen, an old royalist submariner (hidden from the Jackal's government who overthrew the monarchy) as captain, and various individuals to fit niches within the scouting party including one of the best characters named Ironflanks, a steamman (think the Tinman from the Wizard of Oz) who knows the uncharted territory where the original Camlantis was located.  Quest himself does not go but only is the hiring man.Most of the characters are flawed individuals so we do get very real and very believable characters.There are numerous subplots involving a wealthy shapeshifting character and his lashlite butler (a birdman).  And various side stories revealing backstory of important characters like Billy Snow (the navigator), Ironflanks (the scout), and others.  The novel moves along smoothly with various set pieces keeping the reader guessing who will survive the Indiana Jones adventure and who will not (since many characters of great importance do die throughout).  As you can gather, the story does not slow down at all and with all the action, the book moves quickly even though it is fairly long.If you are into Victorian sci-fi like Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, if you enjoy old school stories like Hammer films or the history of Jack the Ripper, and if you are into steampunk fiction like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, then you'll absolutely love this novel.  If you just like good action books and are into fantasy or sci-fi or period piece mysteries, then you'll love it as well.  It is definately a good read.  It is a shame the author's stories are published in England and only recently have been following here to the states (a year later unless you order from Amazon UK).

Why? Because instead of studying and writing papers like a normal university professor, she's out hunting relics of Camlantis, which everyone knows is a myth.Enter Abraham Quest, the richest man in Jackals, who has been doing his own archaeology on the sly, and found proof that Camlantis exists. Unfortunately, the clues point the way into the heart of darkness itself, the source of the Shedarkshe river in the wilds of a jungle from which no explorer has returned. Camlantis was a utopia, with untold engineering feats, a society of pacifists, and Amelia and Abraham are convinced that it holds the key to making their own war-torn society a better place. But it means risking lives in order to see that goal realized.Hunt spends the first half of the book setting up the story, and because there's a lot going on, several characters to introduce, and a world to build, the time it takes to do this isn't unreasonable. However, it does make the first half slow-going. His prose can be dense, which also slows down the pacing and flow, but does make for a richer world. I love Hunt's metaphors. He is truly clever with his descriptions, adding depth to the world at the same time.Finally at about the halfway mark everything goes wrong for our protagonists. And not just wrong, I mean horribly, how in the heck are they going to get out of this without dying, wrong. It's a series of life-threatening events that lasts the entire second half of the book. Hunt spins threads between all the characters deftly, so that when everything begins to collide, the weaving stories makes sense despite the chaos. Awesomeness on many levels.Set in an Earth that could have been, Hunt mixes machinery, magic, and a dizzying assortment of races with alacrity. There's the race of mechanical steammen, who, while they have no country to call their own, still have autonomy wherever they live. There's the amphibian craynarbians, which unfortunately don't get as much face-time as the others. Also, the flying lizard lashites, who turn out to play an important role. In a story like this the races could have been gimmicky, but the cultures of humans and non-humans alike were all integrated into the plot in satisfying ways.Hunt's steampunk world is ambitious, and while he does an excellent job of introducing it without overwhelming the reader, about 5% of the time I didn't remember or understand a name, race, or piece of equipment. On the whole for such a steep learning curve, only forgetting a small percentage is a petty complaint, and says a lot about the author's world-building, which is complex and fascinating.Magic plays a secondary role to the mechanical, which made me sad because Hunt hints at interesting possibilities he simply doesn't have time to explain or explore. Also, while the pacing is consistent, the flow of action can be jarring, and sometimes I had to re-read a few paragraphs to grasp everything that happens when the action switches. The biggest problem I saw, which could be minor considering the other strengths of the novel, is that with such a large cast it is difficult for the main characters to have any real depth. While the characters have their interesting quirks and motivations, there's no question that for KINGDOM, it's the setting here that's on display--and what a vision it is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Steampunk at its best", "unixReviewTime": 1281139200, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2010"}

However, it is the clarity of this purpose that is the book's central flaw. Mr Hastings' effort to show the giant that was Churchill is such a dominant theme in the book that it tends to submerge some rather uncomfortable facts. For example: Churchill's deeply ingrained racism and the degree of his culpability for the wartime Indian famine are only lightly touched upon; Hastings deals very superficially, and wholly in Churchill's favour, with the persistent historical controversy regarding Churchill's sacking of Auchinleck in North Africa in the immediate aftermath of the general's successful reorganisation of the British Army into battle groups and his defeat of Rommel; he barely mentions Bill Slim and the fact that Britain's greatest wartime general was relegated to the theatre that Churchill thought least of; and he excuses the prime minister's flights of fancy and disasterous choices later in the war as the result, in large measure, of old age and stress.This is not to deny the importance of Churchill as war leader: his insistence on continuing to fight after the fall of France was a demonstration of enormous moral courage; his understanding of the importance of drawing the USA into the war to have any hope of victory was more clear sighted than most of his contemporaries; his decision to sink the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir displayed the sort of ruthlessness that was essential to winning the war; his unsucccessful efforts at establishing a democratic Poland at the end of the war show a sense of decency and honour that contrast favourably with Stalin's monstrousness and Roosevelt's disinterest on this issue.Mr Hastings book would have been even more interesting if he had allowed his portrait of Churchill to emerge from this sort of evidence rather than seeking to impose such an overwhelmingly heroic impression on much more complex material.Nevertheless, it should be said that few readers could ever feel shortchanged by Hastings' historical writing, which is as ever humane and lucid, and the breadth and depth of his research is, as always, awesome.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A portait of Churchill with a few warts", "unixReviewTime": 1325376000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2012"}

Mr. Hastings is an engaging writer easily mixing rather cold facts with pointed stories to keep the reader interested.  This book moves along very quickly and will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone interested in Winston Churchill or WWII.  The footnotes and resources listed are voluminous and the maps, the few that are included, are excellent.Of course, we must admit there are many books on WWII and on Mr. Churchill; however, I think Mr. Hastings has added something to the previous story.  The author obviously holds Mr. Churchill in notable esteem and contends he towered above other figures that held the stage of history with him.  The war was his finest hour.  What is new is Max Hastings clearly sees the flaws in the man and his country.  Mr. Hastings has an incredible ability to boil down the essence of what was going on in the war and then accurately relate those events to the leaders.  He unerringly describes how the leaders of the US, UK, and USSR mixed together and how that mix impacted the decisions of that age.Mr. Hastings recognizes the irony of going to war to keep the Nazi&#8217;s out of Poland and then watching them fall under a greater evil in Stalin&#8217;s communist.  He records Churchill&#8217;s despairing struggle to prevent it.Winston&#8217;s War poignantly points out how Churchill, with his back against the wall, managed to weld the nation together long enough to pull it through the worst times in 1940 only to watch it gradually fall apart as the war progressed to a victorious conclusion.  He was the man for the hour, but he was not the man for all hours.  Winston Churchill was a 19th century man, and could not lead a 20th century nation into the future.  Churchill saw it was a future of socialism, which he rejected, but could not come up with the means to fight.  At least the future he secured for the UK was not one of rule by a foreign tyranny.The author is able to balance, better than other authors on Churchill I have read, the legitimate criticisms of the man with the reality of his accomplishments.  Comparing the good to the bad in a fair and responsible way is not easy, not in the least; however, Mr. Max Hastings does it as well as any man could.Mr. Hasting&#8217;s insights on WWII are worth the price of the book all by themselves.  He understands the power of the German Army and identifies them as the best army in the field during WWII.  The author perceptively points out a few German divisions gave the allies fits in Africa and Italy and affirms that without the Soviet Union England and the US could not have defeated Hitler.  Mr. Hastings peppers his writings with these blunt insights which helps us understand the decisions of the time better than most books which relate the arguments but not the unvarnished truth that was being confronted.An excellent and nearly flawless book.AD2", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Deep Insights into Churchill and his Era", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2013"}

He was multi-dimensional: warrior, politician, gifted writer, orator, painter, and unconventional character.  In 1940, Britain was one of the world's preeminent powers (before the post-war ascendancy of the United States and the Soviet Union).  I had voraciously read Churchill's six-volume memoir of the Second World War and his History of the English-Speaking Peoples.  I have read numerous biographies such as The Last Lion, Churchill: A Study in Failure 1900-1939, and Franklin and Winston.  Now here is another biography, which from the onset provides fresh insights into Churchill's impact during the war, beginning with his appointment as wartime Prime Minister by the king during May 1940 - a warrior was needed!  British expeditionary forces were already in France striving to halt the German blitzkrieg through Belgium, and would soon find themselves being evacuated from Dunkirk.  Western Europe was reeling and facing impending defeat.Yet one man, with doubters all around him, refused to concede defeat.  By his steadfast courage, wit, and groundless optimism, Churchill infused the British people with an astonishing attitude of defiance.  After the fall of France, Britain stood alone against the Axis Powers.  Churchill went through excruciating moments during this time, as Max Hastings reveals that Churchill, as early as the summer of 1940, uttered his prophetic conviction that the United States would come to the aid of the Allies.  Hastings states that Churchill's \"supreme achievement in 1940 was to mobilize Britain's warriors, to shame into silence its doubters, and to stir the passions of the nation.\"  Hastings astutely writes: \"As Churchill always recognized, modern war is waged partly on battlefields, and partly also on airwaves, front pages and in the hearts of men and women.\"At the onset, Britain required both its Navy and its Royal Air Force (RAF) to prevent a German invasion.  The odds seemed slim, but strategic plans were put in place, and against all odds the pilots of the RAF, fighting with intrepid tenacity, won the Battle of Britain by the end of 1940, the first British victory of the war, which gave assurance to Americans that Britain would not fall.  Yet Britain would stand alone for nearly a year and a half before the Soviet Union battled the Germans in war, and more than two years before the U.S. joined with Britain to launch the invasion of North Africa during November of 1942; while one month earlier, Montgomery, with around 1,000 tanks (of which nearly half were from the U.S. - at last), proceeded to win Britain's first large-scale land victory against Germans, in Egypt at the Battle of El Alamein.Though I was born after WW II was over, I fought in Vietnam, and I certainly consider Churchill to be a magnificent wartime leader, deserving of tremendous praise.

Yet during the war Churchill's strategic vision deserted him so many times that Hastings' compliments seem forced.  He wrote, \"Churchill's grand vision of the war was superb.\" p. 360. Resumes that begin with Gallipoli and end up defending the bloody Italian mountain campaign will not win you many jobs as a strategist. Events in Churchill's life that Hastings is forced to write about often undermine the story Hastings wants to tell of the greatest ever British political leader.One minor correction, the picture between pages 430 and 431 of Admiral William D Leahy, Alan Brooke, Hastings Ismay and George Marshall incorrectly lists U.S. Admiral Ernest King as Admiral Leahy. Note to the editors: Admiral William Leahy is authorized to wear the right shoulder \"aiguillette\" as an aide to President Roosevelt; Admiral King is not.Two notes on Allied strategy. First, Churchill insisted until virtually the end of the war that the British Army in Europe be granted the highest strategic and logistic priority. Churchill's views were eagerly followed by British C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke and British 21st Army Group Commander, Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery. Hastings wrote, \"British attempts to ignore their own impoverishment and retain a giant's role in the world inspired pity among their American friends, contempt among their American enemies.\" p. 419. It mattered little what most Americans thought. Only General Dwight Eisenhower's opinion really mattered and he usually sided with the British, at least until March 28, 1945. One gets a picture of General Eisenhower standing on the banks of the Rhine River in March 1945 with C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke, literally begging the British Field Marshal for a chance to \"disperse\" his forces, to unleash the Bradley's American Army into central Germany. Brooke agreed but it was far too little, far too late. There were only 40 odd days left in the war. In \"Armageddon,\" Hastings wrote, \"Montgomery's most serious weakness ... stemmed from a refusal to acknowledge that in north-west Europe it was now essential for the British to defer to the overwhelming dominance of the United States (Army).\" p. 27. Montgomery never did force himself to accept the obvious, but that was not his job. British wartime strategy came from the top down. It came from Winston Churchill and his Chiefs of Staff and they routinely insisted on fighting the Americans tooth and nail for logistic and strategic priority for the British Army in Europe.Second, the Italian campaign was the longest running argument between the Anglo-American Allies. The British supported it and tried to get more U.S. soldiers and ships committed to the campaign. The Americans disliked the whole Mediterranean theater and especially the campaign in Italy because of the terrible mountainous terrain. British official Harold Macmillan wrote, \"The more one sees of this (Italian) peninsula, the less suited it seems for modern military operations.\" p. 357. This was obvious to any first year officer cadet. But it was apparently not obvious to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his military advisors who berated the Americans time and again over operations in Italy. Two of the strongest proponents of continued operations in Italy were C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke and Mediterranean Theater Commander Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson. But we now know that they did not support operations in Italy at all and, in fact, were of the opposite view. Alan Brooke told U.S. historian Forrest Pogue, \"... There is no doubt that Winston had a Balkan liking ... and he used to make matters rather difficult for me with Marshall with statements he would make, which Marshall would often think were inspired by me and they were not ... I couldn't go to him (Marshall) and say I don't agree with a word my Prime Minister is saying.\" C.  Catherwood, Winston Churchill, p. 260. And Sir Henry Wilson said, \"... I knew that strategically that was the only way (Southern France)... None of us liked the offensive against Italy really, against those mountains.\" C. Catherwood, p. 261. British Intelligence Officer Sir Kenneth Strong confirms Wilson's statement. \"Churchill's obsession with the \"underbelly\" theory has always struck me as a strategic aberration. General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson ... told me early in 1944 that he also favored the American view, but said that it was difficult for him to oppose the Prime Minister's policy.\" Sir Kenneth Strong, Intelligence at the Top, p. 130. Allied strategy in Italy was being determined, not by the best military minds available, but by an amateur politician bent on getting his own way, as Alan Brooke once put it,'to spite the Americans.'At conferences in Cairo and Teheran Churchill chose to fight the Overlord battle with the Americans just one more time. It was a huge mistake. Presidential advisor Harry Hopkins had warned Churchill to back off or be prepared to go it alone at Teheran. Churchill refused to listen and paid the price. Roosevelt had tired of listening to Churchill's rants. He refused numerous requests for private meetings with the British Prime Minister. Churchill liked to blame Roosevelt's casual socializing for his lack of free time, but Hastings correctly points out \"... that such evasion(s) reflected policy rather than 'mischances.'\" p. 348.Churchill had overplayed the British hand throughout WW II. He got the headlines he wanted from the British press and this in turn inspired a reasonable war effort from the British people. Hastings wrote, \"... the United States, its leaders and people alike still overestimated the wealth of Churchill's nation. Few grasped the extent of its moral, strategic and financial exhaustion.\" p. 443. In Bernard L. Montgomery, the British people had a brilliant field marshal who never lost a battle, and whose battles all went exactly as he had planned them. Financially, there was seldom the slightest hint of long-term British fiscal doom covered by the press during the war. British and Americans shared an overly optimistic future for the British Empire and the British economy. These opinions were not divined by reading the tea leaves, but by reading British newspapers.It was all part of Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill's war winning strategy. British economic and military power were hyped and exaggerated far beyond their actual war-time performances. Neither American military or economic aid was seen as critical by the average British subject. \"... Only a third of those (British) questioned held favorable views of Americans... Americans were actually held in lower esteem than Italians. Yet nine of ten Britishers thought well of Russia and the Russians.\" Peter Lyon, Eisenhower, p. 278.Hastings writes, \"There is an escapable pathos about Churchill's predicament in the last year of the war... His engagement with armies became ... that of a tourist, because he could no longer much influence their movements.\" p. 482. Yet on March 31, 1945 Churchill wrote Eisenhower a letter complaining bitterly about Eisenhower's decision to reinforce Bradley with Simpson's Ninth U.S. Army which had been attached to Montgomery's 12th British Army Group. British complaints went all the way to the Combined Chiefs in Washington which forced George Marshall to ask Eisenhower to explain his decisions. There were barely 40 days left in the war. The Americans hoped to get in at least one full-scale offensive before the war ended, if they could just get the British out of the way. The last large American offensive which had full British approval went back to Operation Cobra in the Carentan at the end of July 1944. Montgomery usually gets blamed for his intransigence with the Americans, but the real culprit was P.M. Churchill and his refusal to see a reduced role for the dying British Empire in a post-war world. Max Hastings is forced to struggle with Churchill's flawed strategic vision throughout his book.

The author's claim that Churchill was the only leader that could have done what he managed to do for Britain during the war is undoubtedly correct.  He convincingly tells of Churchill's failure to recognize the future and the British people's need for change that ensured the PM's ouster as the war wound down and the war-weary populace prepared to return to peacetime and the resumption of their lives.While no detailed knowledge of WW2 history is needed to enjoy the book, it is helpful in placing in context the events that most affected Churchill and his leadership of the British Empire.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Balanced View", "unixReviewTime": 1294963200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2011"}

In this book, he tells the familiar story of Churchill in World War Ii, but does so in a fresh way, adding negative as well as positive criticism of Churchill's performance.Hastings contrasts Churchill's will with that of French premiere Reynaud and some of the defeatists in England.  Churchill's combative instincts and his ability to communicate to mobilize all of England explains much of the difference between the outcomes of the Battle of France and the Battle of England.  Of course, one should not ignore the geographic vulnerability of France versus the benefits of the English Channel and one should not ignore the effectiveness of the RAF.Hastings is critical of the performance of the English Army, which surprises me.  However, he does make the case that unlike World War I, the English troops simply never were a match for the Germans unless they had overwhelming advantages in men, air cover, and artillery.  He is also critical of the English commanders.  Hastings is also effective at coveying the great crisis of confidence in England and Churchill's ability in overcoming it, but the ultimate inability of even Churchill to reverse the inevitable downfall of the English Empire by the end of the war.Churchill's penchant for distracting adventures and reluctance to focus on the need to win the war in the west via a cross channel invasion are criticized.  Although Hastings believes Churchill was right to dissuade the U.S. from mounting suicidal cross channel invasions too early, he does concede that Churchill was too hesitant to launch D-Day.In the end Hastings makes the case for the great man theory of history -- without Churchill's strong leadership, exceptional energy, and great communication skills, the war in the west may have turned out much differently.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Churchill as the Great Man of WWII", "unixReviewTime": 1281571200, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2010"}

Despite the teeming shelves of Churchillian literature this new book is well worth reading for the insights into the character, will and bulldog determination of WSC.Churchill became  Prime Minister of Great Britain on May 10, 1940. He replaced the disastrous appeasement policiy of Neville Chamberlain the Tory premier WSC served as Lord of the Admirality. On that same day Hitler's hordes invaded the Low Countries. Soon Churchill was charged with having to rescue the British Army from Dunkirk; keep the nation going despite the Battle of Britain and deal with social unrest at home. Churchill was a Victorian man who refused independence for India and wanted to keep the British Empire intact on the world stage. In this mission he failed as the little English donkey England had to sit at the summit of Western leadership with the behemoth bear of Stalin's Russia and the soaring England of the behemoth arsenal of democracy and military might of FDR's United States.Churchill is faulted for wanting to micromanage the conduct of the war. He England into nonproductive expeditions into the Balkans, Greece and wanting the invasion of the continent to go through Italy. Instead America prevailed and the invasion was launched on D-Day June 6, 1944 on the beaches of Normandy in northwestern France. Churchill's greatest contribution was in his stirring oratory over the BBC, House of Commons and to the beleagured but tough British men and women.Churchill was an egocentric aristocrat who was petted and spoiled. His longsuffering wife Clementine would goad him into better behavior with subordinates and try to keep his drinking and smoking within bounds. He was, nevertheless, a towering political genius whose courage, fortitude and admantine refusal to surrender led the Western Allies to victory in 1945. He distrusted Russia but knew he needed the Red Empire to be on Britain''s side if the war was to be won.He cherished a friendship with FDR knowing England would not survive unless the United States became an active participant in the war. Churchill's Great Britain was the militarily weakest of the big three coalitoon as US and Soviet arms dwarfed those of the land of hope and glory.  Churchill had difficulties with mediocre generals never finding the Wellington he wanted.Max Hastings is a great historian writing in a clear and understandable style.

From my perspective, the narrative is a balanced account of the Prime Minister giving praise when deserved but also criticism when deserved.This book does not seek to retell the full story of Churchill during the war but rather to present a portrait of his leadership as Prime Minister, set in the context of Britain's national experience. And with that qualification, I thought his narrative was worth five stars.The author provides much information on the deeds of Churchill and provides many quotes and diary entries from fellow politicians, the military and the British public. Alan Brooke who intimately worked and advised the PM and had to constantly curtail Churchill's impractical military operations is quoted the most. WC's wife Clementine also provides insight as well as his friends.The book is laid out step by step chronologically beginning with WC's ascension to Prime Minister and the German invasion in May 1940, to the dark days of U-boats and the Luftwaffe striking British cities and her ships, to give comfort and motivation to the British public, to influencing FDR's participation in the war, to dark days once again when toward the end of the war WC lost his influence with FDR and saw the victory of German defeat overshadowed by the hegemony of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.The coverage of the war with regards to Churchill's influence, both good and bad, was broad and worthwhile and included the campaigns in France 1940, North Africa, Italy, Balkans and again in northern Europe 1944-45. Churchill was constantly fighting at home as well, fending off political opponents who disagreed with his decisions and were trying to relieve him from office. Another chapter covers Churchill with Stalin and the Eastern Front which was probably my favorite chapter in the book. The author discusses the extensive spy ring Stalin had in place in London and Washington; Stalin was aware of many things and knew that Churchill's promises of a second front in France in 42 or 43 was a deception. The chapter also points out that the aristocratic heritage of WC and FDR as well as the anti-Communism ideologies of the two would be too much of a hurdle for Stalin to truly trust his partners. Its also stated that the belief of the two western partners could befriend and control Stalin as being totally naive, vain and delusional.The book also has a few maps and some interesting photos to study. It also has a decent Notes section, Bibliography and Index.Just like FDR, WC did not keep a diary while in office; he did not want to expose his follies and inconsistencies to posterity so the author points out many times from quotes from WC, his intimates and opponents that Churchill as PM was mindful of his potential role as a stellar performer upon the stage of History. While Chamberlain shied away from that performance, that duty, Churchill eagerly sought it out and relish it. This was his opportunity to erase the humiliation of the failure at Gallipoli and to forge a new bolder history for himself and Great Britain no matter what the costs.By these quotes, the judgments and reactions of the British public are also brought out to give the reader the collective opinion of WC's performance throughout the war.If you're looking for one book of WSC during the war years, this would be a good candidate. It carefully weaves Churchill's reasons and motivations for his actions within the framework of WWII, letting the reader understand the influence, good and bad, that Churchill had on the war and its participants.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An informative and balanced account of WSC", "unixReviewTime": 1276300800, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2010"}
{"reviewerID": "AHPV4F8IVSC39", "asin": "0007263686", "reviewerName": "Douglas B. Moran \"Computer+History/Politics\"", "helpful": [30, 49], "reviewText": "My initial reaction to the book was quite positive, but faded slowly as my expectations were unmet.  The author's admiration of Churchill while declaring his failings prompted an unfulfilled expectation of an account that looked at both the successes and failures and how they related: Did they reflect conflicting aspects of his personality or were they simply different facets? Unfortunately there is no such yin-yang.While the book _asserts_ that Churchill was the great leader, what it _discusses_ are his various disastrous decisions and his limited influence with the allies.  As other reviewers have noted (eg, Geoffrey Wheatcroft in a 2010-04-26 NY Times review), while Churchill's energy, willfulness and inspiration was critical in keeping Britain from surrendering, this book leads the reader to consider Churchill's contributions as a net negative starting shortly after the US entry into the war.  The author may have expected the readers to have the details of Churchill's strengths and accomplishments at their fingertips, but this is unreasonable for the general audience.  And the omission of this coverage is not due to a lack of space: There are plenty of trivial and tangential details that could easily have been omitted.On Churchill's major mistakes:  Anyone with an intermediate interest in WW2 history is likely to be aware of all of these except \"the second Dunkirk\". The treatment of that event left me unclear whether it was Churchill's fault (confused leadership) or that of a dysfunctional, incompetent military bureaucracy that he inherited.  The book's account of the decision-making process is unsophisticated and terse: It first provides a quick statement of Churchill's characteristics behind his bad judgment, followed by an enumeration of the officials who opposed it and then a statement that Churchill prevailed by force of personality.  Typically, the coverage of the results of the decision goes far beyond what is needed to convincingly demonstrate its folly.  It recounts details that are irrelevant--being far outside Churchill's purview (eg, the movements of individual battalions)--and that are well-covered in many previous histories.  There are long stretches where Churchill's name is not even mentioned.  What I had expected was an emphasis on what led up to the decision and why the problems had not been anticipated or were downplayed. (NOTE: this is my biggest interest in reading history)The book's coverage is maddeningly uneven. For example, the various Greek debacles get detailed coverage, but problems that seem to me to be even bigger failures get only passing mention, without any indication of the degree of Churchill's awareness of them and what, if anything, he tried to do about them.  For example, gross failures in various major army commands in the use of intelligence, including Ultra. For example, situations that appear to have inflicted more damage to Britain's industrial capacity than German bombers: Substantial manufacturing capacity wasted on obsolete and useless armaments; shoddy manufacturing that required substantial repairs to make weapons usable; large quantities of armaments repeatedly damaged and destroyed during shipping because of negligent handling and grossly inadequate packaging.  Related example: The convoys to Russia were taking tremendous, unsustainable losses--ships and sailors--but the book paints a picture that much of what they were carrying was useless to the Russians (obsolete, damaged).  Despite the _issue_ of such support to Russia being a top-level strategic priority, the book again fails to address Churchill's involvement.Similarly, one of the major themes in the book is the limitations/failures/inferiority of the British Army, both its leaders and its soldiers.  While the book covers Churchill's frustrations with various individuals, it didn't give me any sense of whether he was aware of the claimed institutional problem.  My inference is that he wasn't because I didn't spot evidence that his plans accommodated such. Furthermore, I speculated that Churchill, himself part of these institutions, was partially blinded to the underlying problems (but less than most). While the book provides some support for this--primarily in the descriptions of failed commanders--it doesn't go any further.  This is surprising in the context that Gen Marshall's reformation of the US Army is a major topic of WW2 histories.Throughout the book we are told of the military's objections to Churchill's constant \"meddling\".  If this involvement was in fact so _overwhelmingly_ negative, the book fails to reconcile this with its repeated assertions of Churchill's brilliance, knowledge and tenacity. For example, even if Churchill's proffered _solution/idea_ proved to be unworkable, had he identified a real problem and in the process forced the military to address it?  Or were they simply off-the-wall distractions?The book's focus on Churchill is too extreme, diminishing those around him to insignificance.  If this were a movie, no one among the British cast would qualify as a supporting actor, some would be bit players, but most would be merely extras. This was too out-of-balance to be credible to me.  Also, a critical part of leadership is identifying, supporting and developing subordinates, but the book provides none of this.The author's trove of details, although tangential, suggested the build-up to a great story, but it rarely rose above the type of events usually classified as gossip: low level chronicling + reinforcing quotes. Example: Who met Churchill at the airport or train station and what he was sitting on when they arrived. This is the heavily trodden ground that the book's introduction (available online) had led me to expect would be slid over.Although some of these details were potentially significant, the book failed to provide the necessary background or connections.  For example, on Churchill's many trips, who traveled with him is detailed, but what they discussed and how it affected decisions and relationships is almost entirely ignored.  The one time I remember this being addressed was a negative--the plane was too noisy for them to be able to hear each other.SUMMARY: This was a book that just didn't add up. Too many of the details didn't add up to anything significant.  And the significant claims didn't have enough consistency and coherence to add up to something credible, although they could providing interesting discussion topics.-- Lesser editorial criticism --While the book is mostly well-written, I repeatedly encountered opaque sentences that stopped me cold. Rereading would give me the rough intent, and seeing the grammatical structure could take several more attempts.In various quotes, there are words and phrases that I could understand only by inference from the context (and I had lived in Britain for a year).  Since such a quote adds nothing, the author should have either explained such, found a substitute or dropped it.Many of the quotes were the type that one expects of an author reporting his own research, but here I felt they were unnecessary and diverted from the purported focus.

Except for the acknowledgements, bibliography and such, there was no more.The excellent writer and detailed-obsessed military historian Max Hastings had brought us to the end of Churchill's reign as the war leader of the British Empire.You can measure Churchill, the man, by the thousands of books, movies, documentaries and other expositions about him.In Hastings, we find much that is new. As with many contemporary histories of WWII, more than a little comes from the once again closed Soviet archives. But much more comes from the diaries and unpublished letters of people, particularly the little people, the ones who in a democracy elect those who lead.Hastings leaves us in absolutely no doubt of Churchill's unique accomplishments - and his failures.For many months, the future of any vestige of democracy in Europe and perhaps the world rested on Churchill's shoulders. Through his oratory and pluck alone, Churchill encouraged  battered and, in fact, defeated Britain to rally itself and fight on, despite the fact that literally all its artillery, amour, small arms and military vehicles had been left on the battlefields of France. Churchill pleaded and cajoled to get Franklin Roosevelt into the European war, but Roosevelt basically wouldn't budge.For a while, it was Churchill, a few hundred brave pilots, a few thousand ground crew and radar plotters who kept Britain in the war.Hastings tracks the public opinion of the day. Churchill had long been a divisive character, long relegated to the back benches of Britain's ruling class for his outspoken opinions on the dangers of a rearmed and resurgent Germany. Neville Chamberlain had captured the support of the people who believed that giving Hitler what he wanted was the road to peace.It was not and the 66 year old Churchill, called a war monger by so many, was asked by the King to become Prime Minister.It is now widely agreed that Churchill was the only man who could have saved Britain.Hastings keeps his focus on Churchill as war leader, but lets us see how the world around him reacted to his larger-than-life presence. He irritated and frustrated his military leaders by his constant interference and demands for action now. He lifted the spirits of his people in his visits to the bombed out streets of London. He bestirred the Members of Parliament (and controlled them) with his wit and guile. Finally, he roused the world through oratory of a brilliance rarely seen.Churchill, as Hastings endlessly points out, was not perfect. Far from it. His military plans were more often than not entirely impractical and when he did succeed in getting his ideas acted upon, they often resulted in disaster. But strategically, Churchill was ahead of his generals who for the most part never rose to anything near Churchill's greatness.Hastings correctly believes that it was the military of the Soviets that defeated Germany and that Britain and the United States played a subordinate role militarily. No serious student of the period can disagree. It was the Soviets who broke the armies of the Germans and their allies. But Churchill believed he enjoyed some kind of personal relationship with Stalin, a delusion he persisted in almost to the end of the war.It is fascinating to read the letters and diaries of the average citizens, many, if not most, of whom revered Churchill the war leader, while reserved about Churchill the domestic leader. The letters of the committed leftists are chilling to read. Military men and Churchill's staff left behind copious memoirs, published and unpublished, about their impressions. Hastings draws upon all of this and more to produce a truly in-depth history of Churchill's six years as the most powerful leader in British history and one of the most remarkable men to have appeared in Western civilization.The pity is that history is no longer taught in American schools and what has replaced it has little relation to history. Thus the children of today will grow up with little idea of how close the freedom they abuse came so close to being snuffed out were it nor for Winston Churchill who roused the West to save itself.Next time, perhaps, we will not be so fortunate as to have a Churchill.Hastings makes it clear just how remarkable Churchill, as the war leader of his people, was.Jerry", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A magnificient history of Churchill as war leader", "unixReviewTime": 1283126400, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2010"}

Max Hastings has accomplished a brilliant task: painting a full portrait of a complex man, using all the colors of the human palette without favoring one over the other.For lay Churchillian fossil hunters--eager to crack open that one rock which will reveal the perfectly defined imprint of a long-extinct species of leader, Winston's War is the ideal tool for discovery. In page after page, Hastings gives us Churchill the humanist, the warrior, the worrier, the optimist, the depressed, the badgerer and and the beguiler. But most of all, Hastings reveals as few have before, Churchill's devotion to the Great Britain that once was and, in his vision, could be again, if only his plans were properly attended to by generals and allies whose actions were otherwise limited to the near horizon of self-interest.The same brush that defines Churchill with such clarity and vibrance does not neglect to flesh out other characters from that era -- Roosevelt and the American chiefs of staff, and Winston's own stable of generals and advisers receive equal amounts of critical paint, and not always in pleasing hues.Hastings is not all laud and champagne for Churchill; Winston's War gives us a churlish Winnie, a frustrated warfighter, a spoiled child, an unthinking master, a fretful husband, and bitter father. Through Hasting's sharply focused lens of research and discovery, we watch Churchill fall victim to the duplicity of perceived friends--Beaverbrook, for one, with all his smarminess and deceit--and to seek the embrace of the spitting cobra of Stalin in order to save Poland from the fangs of Soviet domination. Just as in a horror movie in which a hapless character is about to turn a corner to face a bloodthirsty monster the audience can already see, Hastings' portrayal of the Churchill/Stalin matchup will have you screaming, \"Run, Winston, run!\" and yet you will be unable to stop turning the pages, just as history could not be stopped or re-directed.But for all his foibles and failings--and there were many--the scales of judgment must, if Hastings has it right--and I believe he does--tip easily toward a near reverence for Churchill's place in history. He was not as much a man of his time, as he was the right man for his time. An anachronism from the very start of the war, Churchill nonetheless was able to poke, prod, cajole, inspire, and lead even when so many forces--social, political, and economic--were placed in his path. As Hastings puts it, \"He was one of the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs whom the world has ever known ...

Winston's War also adds to the recent spate of books - Carlo D'Este's Warlord; Andrew Robert's Hitler and Churchill and Masters and Commanders, and Berthon and Potts', Warlords - \"analyzing\" Churchill's leadership role and his success/failure as Great Britain's Commander in Chief. Hastings' new book differs from these previous Churchill book specifically in its focus - this book is all Churchill and all WWII, and is another excellent addition to the history of both.First a brief note on Hastings' \"writing style\". The author has seemingly read everything available - first-hand accounts from diaries and letters, newspaper accounts, military archives and records, etc. - and combined all this research/data into a very compelling, insightful, extremely well written account. The author is also anything but subtle. In this book for instance, Henry \"Chips\" Cannon is described as the \"consummate ass\" and that Lord Gort, although personally courageous - \"lacked brains\" - this within the first 25 pages. The point here is that Hastings does not mince words and is never shy about voicing his educated opinion - including about Churchill.Winston's War picks up on May 10th, 1940, as Churchill assumed the premiership - \"The Phony War\" in Europe coming to an end with the Nazi Army mobilizing. Thus begins Churchill's heroic struggle to save his country and the world from Hitler's tyranny - and what a story it is. Hastings chronicles the dark yet heroic days of 1940-41 when Churchill and his countrymen stood alone; the partnership with Stalin and FDR after Barbarossa and Pearl Harbor; and as odd man out of The Big Three as events, Soviet man-power and American war production passed Churchill and his country by. And as Hastings painstakingly points out there was plenty of Churchillian good and bad - decisions and behavior - during these war years, for Winston packed a half dozen lifetimes worth of activity in these busy years, which in and of itself was all part of a very busy and active life.This book is by no means a hatchet-job or even to a lesser degree - revisionist history. The author makes it very clear that the same qualities that propelled Churchill through the crisis of the early years of WWII are the same that frustrated his military men and his allies throughout the war's later years - Churchill was always Churchill - and the world is a better place for that.There is a treasure trove of information here not to be missed - An excellent book and highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hastings does it again", "unixReviewTime": 1322697600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2011"}

A superb blend of narrative and analysis that clearly addresses the great man's strengths and weaknesses but just as important details the military, strategic and economic constraints with which he had to wrestle. Put simply, continuing the war in 1940, or even embarking on it 1939, was one of the greatest gambles in history because the British state and its empire were simply overmatched by Germany in 1939 let alone when it was occupying most of western Europe. However, the British had some advantages and by and large Churchill was able to put them to good use. Where failures occurred it was because of the gap that existed between Churchill's overly romantic appreciation of British strength relative to the reality. But then it was this over appreciation that persuaded him to keep fighting and not come to an accomdation with Germany. Ultimately, Churchill's leadership was a considerable tour de force but then Britain's entire 200 year naval and imperial supremacy was a tour de force whose success depended on numerous factors other than the more traditional ones of land area and big battalions. Ultimately, Churchill's formula for success wasn't that different from that of the two Pitts or Lloyd George....naval supremacy and strong European or extra European allies.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A brilliant account", "unixReviewTime": 1342656000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2012"}

It grew out of a comment made by Roy Jenkins in the course of writing his 2001 biography, which is arguably the best single-volume work of its kind.  As other reviewers have noted, the book also works as an unauthorised sequel to William Manchester's incomplete The Last Lion trilogy, which is the best biography of Churchill's life and times there is.  This is a focus on Churchill as war leader, not a study of the man per se.To sum up the theme of this book, Churchill got a lot of the little things wrong, but got the big thing - winning WWII - right.  As it turned out, he was also right about the post-war world and the threat of exchanging the Nazi empire for a Soviet one, but was powerless to arrest this on his own, and was powerless to convince Roosevelt and the US to assist.  In part, ths was due to his getting the little things wrong.From the fall of France, the Battle of Britain, North Africa, Italy, and D-Day, the big picture of WWII is laid out.  Greece was perhaps Churchill's last success of WWII, at least by some values of success.There is sorrow here also - the loss of Poland, the looming horrors of the Soviet Iron Curtain, all flowing from the fact that having allied with Stalin to defeat Hitler, the western allies were stuck with Stalin to the bitter, bitter end.  Without Stalin, there could be no battlefield victory for the west; with him, the victory was gall and wormwood.This is a superb volume, dealing with the role of Churchill in WWII, and the role he played in shaping the post-war world.  Although never stated in the book, it is clear that to the extent that the US and Britain today share a \"special relationship\" - and they do, and arguably stronger now than in 1945 - this should be seen as Churchill's true legacy, one myth he spent his life's work to turn to truth.  Hastings here shows the decline of Britain and her Empire over the course of the war years, the ebb and flow of popular support for Churchill and the war, the troublemakers in Cabinet - to rise above all this, as Churchill did, is probably the truest mark of a great man, save for his utter public lack of any resentment at the loss of office in 1945: his simple exit, without recrimination, shows his complete commitment to British democracy.The book does end in 1945: there is no coda dealing with Churchill's return to the Prime Ministership in later life, or his death nearly 20 years later, so do not expect that at the end.  This is simply a history of wartime Britain as Churchill made it: when his war ended, so did the story.  It is an excellent retelling of those dreadful years when the fate of the world hung in the balance, and Churchill's attempts to bring down Nazi Germany.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Churchill 1940-45", "unixReviewTime": 1285459200, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2010"}

Poss", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "Winston's War is an astonishing feat--it chronicles the activities, thoughts, ideals, politics, relationships, and personality of a man through five long, complex years and does so without becoming boring or losing sight of some one of these parts of the man. The man is Winston Churchill and Max Hastings has done a remarkable job of describing Churchill's experience during World War II.Hastings follows Churchill through the war closely, especially during the tense first days of Churchill's premiership and through the American commitment to Europe in North Africa. I won't recapitulate the chronology here--it would bore those already familiar with World War II and just be so many unfamiliar names to those who aren't. The impression gained from this book is that through all five years Churchill was constantly on the go, moving between the headquarters of various generals, the ministries in London, and overseas meetings with his allies, Roosevelt and Stalin. The constant balancing act Churchill faced--as politician, PM, diplomat, strategist, and human being--would have destroyed a lesser man, and Hastings evokes the myriad demanding duties well.The book had two great strengths. The first was the attention Hastings gave to lesser-known operations. This must come with the territory, as Churchill was notoriously fond of derring do like commando raids and sabotage. But Churchill also pushed for, planned, and executed several large-scale but little-known missions during the war. There were, for instance, the \"second Dunkirk\" during late June of 1940, during which more British troops trapped in France were evacuated, and the disastrous invasion of the Aegean in 1943. Churchill's campaign into the Dodecanese, the Greek isles, meant to bring the Turks into the war on the Allied side but was ill-planned and even more ill-fated, reminding many of his botched Gallipoli campaign in the same sea during World War I. He also urged constantly the creation and supply of resistance groups in occupied Europe, the usefulness of which--in light of terrible German reprisals--is still debated. Hastings clearly illustrates the complexity of Allied planning, as numerous proposed or planned operations came to nothing.The book's second strength was Hastings's focus on Churchill the man. It is easy for historians to forget that their subjects got tired, sick, cranky, drunk, or jokey, but Hastings always keeps Churchill as human being in the foreground. He reminds us that, though Churchill is now an inspirational icon, he was an old man. He was moody. He kept odd hours. He was by turns abrupt and affectionate. His health was a constant worry. And he wasn't always popular--in fact, political enemies agitated constantly for his removal from the premiership during the last half of the war. Churchill's story is often one of frustration, especially after the Americans entered the war. Roosevelt, to whom Churchill gave enormous attention early on in the hopes of currying American favor, shunned and ignored Churchill more and more in favor of Stalin. Stalin, who knew Churchill hated the Soviets, was inscrutable but clearly enjoyed the favor he found with Roosevelt at Churchill's expense. Churchill was always the least of the Big Three and he knew it, and his frustration with Stalin and especially Roosevelt was pitiful.Winston's War, of course, is not solely about Winston, and Hastings does an excellent job of describing the personalities and relationships between the many figures--important or not--who interacted with Churchill. As I said, I won't bother with specifics of chronology here. The best thing I can say is to read Winston's War. Max Hastings has written an enormously detailed and engaging book on one of the most important figures in modern history.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent portrait of Churchill in wartime", "unixReviewTime": 1315094400, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2011"}

However, Max Hastings presents a wonderfully balanced portrait of the man, the politician and the statesman.  While in no way a revisionist history, Hastings has used distance and time to place Churchill's immense contribution in historial perspective.  It is fascinating to compare the Churchill revealed in the \"War Diaries of Field Marshall Lord Alanbrooke\" (from which Mr. Hastings quotes) with Hastings' own work.  Two brillant accounts, one immediate with short term judgements and Mr. Hastings's more measured and from a distance.Churchill's rhetoric and prose shaped the common view of the conduct of WWII.  Brave little Britain fighting alone.  \"The Few, we will fight them on the beaches and never surrender.\" How Churchill's phrases captured and continue to color the imagination.  Much less widely recognized are Britain's problems during wartime.  In a sense disguised by Churchill's masterful language the strikes, the attitudes and the actions of the many Communist sympathizers and the often poor performance of Britain's own Army (especially in the war's early years) have tended to fade from popular viewpoint.  Mr. Hastings deals with the good, the bad and the downright ugly without flinching and without using criticism to deflect from what was an overall immense achievement.Whatever Churchill's failings(and he was human), Max Hastings points out without Winston Churchill at the head of government, Britain would have probably capitulated in 1940-41.  Churchill did not simply capture the British spirit, he to some extend, created it as this book makes clear.  Had Churchill not done so, the outcome could have been entirely different or, at least, more protracted and bloody without Britain as a base to launch the killer blow upon Nazi Germany.Initially, having read many Churchill biographies I was afraid this might be a revisionist history that so many authors are prone to write simply to sell their work. Max Hastings' book about this great man who occupied this pivotal moment is well balanced and researched.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this period of history.

Churchill (WSC) continues to fascinate historians and attract various pundits hoping to make a critical imprint on the landscape of modern moral relativism.  His detractors attempt to belittle his many accomplishments by framing them in the context of his many inconsistencies and, failing that, sometimes resort to ad hominem attacks (\"alcoholic\" being prominent amongst them).  Recently, at least three major military historians, John Keegan, Carlo D'Este and Max Hastings, have written focused biographies of WSC in his capacity as \"warlord\".  Keegan's book is essentially a monograph (interesting, nonetheless).  D'Este wrote a somewhat more encyclopaedic book (WSC's entire military career).  Hastings concentrates on WSC as British supreme commander during the years of the Second World War.  While all three books are good, Hastings' penetrating assessments and candid observations on the protagonist and those who enter his orbit make for more enjoyable reading.Hastings nominally begins his story in 1939, the year Great Britain joined France in declaring war on Hitler's Germany.  However, necessary historical context from pre-war years is also provided, allowing this book to be read independently of any other biography or study. Despite the book's apparently narrow focus, it can be read without background or understanding of the War, itself.Not too surprisingly to his more strident critics, WSC made many minor and several major errors in his capacity as wartime Prime Minister.  He had a penchant for \"meddling\" in military affairs, one shared with at least Stalin and Hitler.  In common with Hitler, WSC had actual front-line combat experience and, also in common with Hitler, demonstrated bravery in battle.  Despite first-hand experience with war and direct, personal knowledge of the consequences of leadership error, both men were fond of audacious and risky enterprises, often-times creating consternation in the ranks of their professional military consultants, sometimes with lamentable results.  Hastings unfavorably contrasts the British military with its German counterpart throughout the book, with the British falling far short of their adversaries in professionalism, skill, dedication, improvisation, equipment, strategy and battlefield tactics.  For that matter, Hastings made the same unfavorable comparison of American troops to the Germans in \"Overlord\", his history of the D-Day invasion.In order to understand the relatively dismal performance of the British Army (in particular), Hastings provides many examples of the incompetence and timidity of the major British commanders who repeatedly come up short in comparison to their North African theater adversary, Rommel and their foe in Italy, Kesselring.  However, even their American counterparts seemed to view them with dismissive attitudes.  On the British home front, morale was undermined by the seemingly interminable duration of the war, pro-Soviet attitudes of many workers (and their \"betters\" in the governing classes), residual exhaustion from the labors of the First World War and concerns regarding the post-war course of their nation.  Hastings repeatedly emphasizes that, almost single-handedly, WSC provided the leadership example required to sustain the war effort from its earliest years (when the situation seemed most hopeless) through its overly long finale, when the population seemed no longer able or interested in sustaining the effort.WSC is both lauded and attacked. His penchant for dramatic forays by small \"elite\" units (which proliferated under his leadership) were generally unsuccessful (1942 Dieppe raid, for example).  His emphasis on the Mediterranean theater was distracting from the major war effort.  His repeated solicitations to the Americans on behalf of various \"pet projects\" became distracting and then annoying.  Nonetheless, WSC had an over-arching and penetrating understanding of grand strategy and, in service to that understanding, was able to bury his antipathy to Communism recognizing that the contributions of the USSR were arch-critical to the defeat of the Nazi armies. Perhaps the most damning (from both the perspective of Roosevelt's U.S. and from Hastings, himself) was WSC's fealty to the concept of the British Empire.  Perceptions that many of Britain's military plans and perspectives were undertaken in service of post-war imperial ambitions soured relations between the Western powers, especially on the U.S. domestic front.From my perspective, Hastings makes his greatest contribution both in this book and in \"Retribution\" (the Pacific War) by clarifying many now controversial wartime actions such as the use of atomic weapons (\"Retribution\") and \"area bombing\" (both theaters of war).  WSC was personally conflicted and committed some of his thoughts to paper.  Still, he observed that, \"Morale is a legitimate military target\" and advocated bombing of German cities not only for that reason (in the early war years to prop up home-front morale) but to convince Stalin that the British were making a meaningful \"second front\" contribution.  Hastings also notes that contemporary technology did not allow \"precision bombing\" or anything even remotely approaching that concept.  Hence, to target factories and military installations, area bombing was necessary. In Hastings' words, \"In addressing the history of the Second World War, it is necessary to recognise the huge moral compromises forced upon the nations fighting under the banner of democracy and freedom.  Britain, and subsequently America, strove for the triumph of these admirable principles wherever the could be secured-with sometimes embarrassing exceptions of the European overseas empires.  But again and again, hard things had to be done which breached faith with any definition of absolute good.  If this is true of politics at all times, it was especially so between 1939 and 1945...the moral and material price of destroying Hitler was high...\". In \"Retribution\", Hastings commented that, \"But in an imperfect world, it seems unrealistic to expect that any combatant in a war will grant adversaries conspicuously better treatment than his own people receive at their hands\".  This all rings true and does much to undermine the \"post-modern\" moral relativism which is currently fashionable. Hastings also repeatedly emphasizes that the Hitler War was won largely due to the efforts and exertions of Stalin's USSR: the role of Lend Lease and the significance of the D-Day landing have been over-amplified with the passage of time.In summary, Hastings characterizes WSC as, \"...one of the greatest actors upon the stage of affairs the world has ever known...If his leadership through the Second World War was imperfect, it is certain that no other British ruler in history has matched his direction of the nation in peril..\"  Certainly, WSC was the greatest statesman of the modern era and his \"grand vision\" enabled the eventual defeat of Hitler, cementing as it did a roiled domestic constituency and contentious allies.  His \"anachronistic delusions\" (sometimes making him appear to FDR and others as a \"traveler from an antique land\") about the future of the British Empire were just that.  His magnificent accomplishments dwarf his strategic shortcomings and can only serve as an example to be emulated by any current or future leader with pretensions to greatness.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Traveler from an Antique Land", "unixReviewTime": 1275436800, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2010"}

Hast-ings is clear in depicting Churchill's flaws, his grandiosity, as well as his indomitable spirit, so singularly important in carrying Britain through the dark early years of the War. His judgment is that Churchill was a unique leader whose importance to his country's (if not its empire's) survival cannot be overstated. Withal, he shows Churchill as a human being, with all the imperfections and foibles of that condition.Secondary characters in the drama are also well drawn, and, indeed, there are a fair number of laughs in the narrative.

This reader, however, cannot understand how a manuscript can go through many readings before publication and still not be purged of the writer's mistakes or poor word choices.

It's a word that those who are not sensitive to words use. Nor does Hastings know the difference between a restrictive and a nonrestrictive clause--to the detriment of his noted clarity.

Churchill's only strategy to win the war, as argued by Hastings, was to somehow get the US involved as an active belligerent ally since he recognized that Britain was incapable of defeating Germany on its own. The fact that the US eventually entered the war against Hitler is not proof that Churchill's strategy actually worked. Indeed, Churcill had absolutely nothing to do with the US's declaration of war against Nazi Germany. After the \"dastardly' attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, FDR could only secure a declaration of war against the empire of Japan. In no way did or would Congress have given him such a declaration against Germany. It was only when Hitler, along with Italy some four days later, declared war against the US that FDR could secure a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Absent Hitler's declaration, there was no way Congress would have declared war against Germany. Churchill had no hand in the US entrance into the war and it cannot be argued that his policy was a success. He could not have foreseen events as they unfolded.

There is the idea in this work that the American's provided a mass of men and material but poor leadership.

There was then a few more volumes to create an excellent trilogy, and then a whole lot more storytelling.  Perhaps part of the problem Feist created for himself is that at the end of that trilogy both Pug and Tomas are powerful, well-nigh unbeatable heroes.  How do you maintain the challenge across another 25 novels?Sometimes its easy to lose track of the scope of what Feist has written here: he has covered 100+ years, multiple generations, various physical locales, and yet still keeps going, at least for another few novels yet.  What he has done is in one sense unparalled.At the Gates of Darkness is best viewed as part of a greater whole.  Yes, you can argue that Feist has one trick for a villlain, and that is reveal that they are a puppet for something even bigger and darker, but on the other hand he is pretty brutal with his characters too, not afraid to kill them off, either in battle or of old age, so for all that there is a view Feist writes \"soft\" stories, I have to disagree.  With all that given though, this entry in the saga is somewhere between pedestrian and segway: it's a light read, able to be knocked over in a few hours, and enjoyable enough, but not earthshattering, for all its teases us with a new view of demons.The star elf brothers Gulamendis and Loramendis get a lot of screen time, as does Amirantha and warrior-priest Sabreena.  All characters have interesting quirks, but are not quite as fully rounded as (say) Arutha, Jimmy the Hand, or even Erik von Darkmoor.  Still there is enough here to keep you reading.  In a few years time perhaps this book will seem better with some necessary set up for later volumes, or perhaps it will be revealed as a pointless digression from the main plot.  If you've read Feist before, get this: its not Feist's best work, but its still OK.

The book is full of great personalities in the deep sport diving community.  On the other hand, Shadow Divers is technically inaccurate and is describes diving in a way that is very different that the training and method driven diving described in Raising The Dead.  Raising The Dead is nearly a \"how to\" book on having the right mindset to be a successful technical diver, even if you never dive deeper than 60 meters; but Shadow Divers, on the other hand, borders on being a \"how not to do it\" book.  In Raising The Dead, the divers follow training procedures and have a full and detailed understanding of the science, physics and physiology of diving.  Shadow Divers seemingly have little understanding; and in fact blame everything on \"narcosis\" at depth, and seemingly have little understanding of oxygen toxicity or carbon dioxide effects on the breathing cycle.

Such is the fate of Phillip Finch's \"Raising The Dead\".  This engaging book concerning the the rarefied world of deep diving will  forever be compared to the ever-popular \"Shadow Divers\" by Robert Kurson.  In both sagas the story unfolds at unimaginable depths where even the slightest mishap/mistake can and does cascade into a fatal event.Notwithstanding further comparisons, \"Raising The Dead\" is a about a diver (David Shaw) who in the span of only 5 years went from a \"rank beginner(diver) to one of the most accomplished and ambitious divers\" in the history of sports diving. The depths to which Shaw achieved (700 ft to 900 ft) were often record dives on a non rebreather apparatus; \"more men have walked on the moon.\"In June 2004, during a cave dive at Bushman's Hole Shaw descended to an astounding depth of almost 900 feet.  What he inadvertently discovered was the body of a young cave diver lost to a diving mishap some 10 years earlier.  Though the author makes little note of the fact that Shaw is deeply religious and that Shaw had a previous dream envisioning that he would discover this body, Shaw felt that God has guided him to the body so that he can retrieve it for the still grieving parents of the young diver.  All this would be little known to the world except for the fact that the mainstream media picked up the story; a story in which the media (newspapers, magazines, radio, television and a video team) intended to document this Herculean effort to retrieve the body at the bottom of a 900 ft deep cave.  This is diving at the extreme!Unfortunately all does not go as planned and as a result, the media and the reader witnesses a tragedy in the making.  Phillip Finch documents this in a manner where the reader is aware of the inescapable tragedy but can't stop reading the next page, much like witnessing a train you know is going to crash but you can't stop looking at it.As is common with all great extreme adventure stories where human boundaries are tested, this story involves the elements of courage vs. calculated recklessness, altruistic goals vs. potentially deadly practicalities and perhaps foreseeable tragedy vs. almost averted tragedy (sadly, \"what could have been\").For those of us who are scuba divers, and even those of you who are not, this is certainly a book worthy of read.

Those who take revenge engage in similar despicable acts as the perpetrators of the original crime. The \"eye for an eye\" philosophy is archaic.

{"reviewerID": "A2F6N60Z96CAJI", "asin": "0007266499", "reviewerName": "Bookreporter", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Sam Bourne is the literary pseudonym of Jonathan Freedland, an award-winning British journalist and broadcaster. His first Bourne novel, THE RIGHTEOUS MEN, is an international bestseller, and he has continued releasing outstanding historical fiction works under the Bourne name ever since. His latest effort, THE FINAL RECKONING, once again has its roots in Judaism. With Freedland being an expert on this topic --- having covered the Middle East struggle for over two decades and chairing a three-day dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians --- there is no more credible author than himself to deliver a voice to the Jewish people through his speculative and enthralling historical fiction.The novel opens with a tragedy. Seventy-seven-year-old Gerald Merton is wearing a bulky overcoat and approaching the United Nations main building. Security had received a tip earlier about an alleged terrorist attack, and a suspect was described with the same features as Merton. Felipe Tavares, a security guard who only sees Merton from behind, shouts a warning and then fires at the suspect, killing him instantly. When they discover that this was no terrorist but an elderly British citizen on a seemingly innocent visit, the UN fears an international incident. Henning Munchau, the primary legal counsel for the UN who is responsible for safety and security, hires an outsider to help smooth things over before the bad press can spread. Being able to brush this under the table is especially vital as the UN is preparing for a large meeting of all their international representatives the very same week.The person Munchau reaches out to is attorney Tom Byrne, whose star has fallen far in recent years and now offers his services to the highest bidder. He owes Munchau a favor and agrees to become the mouthpiece for the UN with Merton's family. Byrne flies to the UK to meet with Merton's sole surviving relative, his daughter Rebecca. Rebecca is at her father's home and is unwilling to accept a token apology from the UN, demanding a face-to-face meeting with the Secretary General himself.While there, Byrne picks up a notebook he mistakes for his own. He realizes the error, but is tempted to read it before returning it to Rebecca. Upon opening it, he is taken back to the early days of World War II in Eastern Europe. The notebook belonged to Rebecca's father, then known as Gershon Matzkin, and contains explicit details of his parents' murder/suicide and the apprehension of him and his sisters by the Nazis from their home in Kovno, Poland. As with many tragic stories from WWII, Matzkin is the sole survivor of the massacre that befalls all the Jewish residents of Kovno, and his sisters are slain.As Byrne researches more into the background of Matzkin, he finds a young man with Aryan features who is able to escape from enslavement in a concentration camp and becomes part of a fledgling Jewish resistance group that goes by the acronym DIN --- Dam Israel Nokeam --- literally translated as \"The blood of Israel will take vengeance.\" DIN operated throughout Eastern Europe during WWII and was instrumental in battling the Nazis and later received assistance from both US and Soviet forces. Once WWII was over, DIN dedicated themselves to hunting down the thousands of criminals left over from the war who did not face judgment at the Nuremberg trials for war atrocities and crimes against humanity with their attempt to wipe the Jewish people off the face of the earth. Byrne, along with Rebecca, follows the evidence and hidden research of DIN and Merton's involvement. It turns out that there was a much larger plan to eliminate millions of Germans via contamination of the water systems and a secondary plan that would poison their bread. Byrne begins to realize that maybe Merton's visit to the UN was not so innocent after all. The big question to be answered is: Who was he after?On the US front, Detective First Grade Jay Sherrill is following up on the criminal investigation from a local standpoint and finds resistance at every turn. Eventually, the NYPD asks him to halt his investigation as the shooting occurred on UN soil and is technically outside of NYPD jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Byrne and Rebecca are sent on a wild goose chase throughout Europe to try to piece together the master revenge plans of DIN and the role Matzkin may have played in them. There appears to be groups that will do anything to stop them from revealing this information and a mysterious faction that is apparently willing to assist them in their quest. As things come to a head and the subject of Matzkin's final act of revenge or reckoning is identified, Byrne realizes he is caught in the middle of an international battle that is far more than he originally signed on for.Using plot twists that are reminiscent of the great British author Robert Goddard, THE FINAL RECKONING is fast-paced historical fiction at its finest. Bourne deftly uses his breadth of knowledge on the historical subtexts that form the foundation for this work of \"fiction\" and has once again created a winner of a novel that will thrill fans of the genre as well as history aficionados who will appreciate the real events and people that provided its inspiration. Bourne specifically references FORGED IN FURY, a 1971 book written by Michael Elkins, a former BBC correspondent to Jerusalem. It provides the fullest account of the actual DIN and their post-war activities that inspired Sam Bourne's extraordinary thriller.--- Reviewed by Ray Palen", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fast-paced historical fiction at its finest", "unixReviewTime": 1292976000, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2010"}

What people think of Indian food can often be a pale imitation of the real authentic dish or, as in many cases, the dishes one enjoys at home are not even known of in the country of their alleged birth.There is no standard Indian fare as each region has a wide-range of specialities, delicacies and signature dishes. Where commonality can be found there will still be regional influences based on practical and historical reasons.  Here Ramsay gets to learn about what makes many of these dishes tick, whether it be taste, visual appearance, nature of ingredients or even a cultural difference.Many cookery books featuring Indian food often manage to confuse the less-experienced reader by over-complicating matters or becoming intimidating through their desire to be authentic. Ramsay, whilst trying to keep the food true to its roots, acknowledges and accepts some practical differences - not everybody will have access to all of the cooking implements and fresh ingredients that would be desirable yet with a slight compromise and the use of ingredients that are increasingly-available in larger supermarkets around the world you will still get a dish that could be fit for a King, a Maharajah or a good family get together. With a little bit of effort one can enjoy a taste of India from your own kitchen.At times one might forget this is principally a recipe book due to the wonderful colourful photographs and light, free-flowing text. It is like having a quality informal travel guide with a lot of recipes and expert advice thrown in. Each recipe is well-presented with much background information, tips and tricks and, as one would expect, one does not need to be a professional chef to follow and understand the instructions.It would have been nice if more of the knowledge gained from his research could have been added to the book to add further \"background impact\" but then the book might have been a series of volumes and not so kitchen-friendly. Similar a version of the book with copies of the television series on a DVD or Blu-Ray disk would have been great, but licensing and technical issues involved with the television world still get in the way. If you get the chance to see the series or to buy a DVD/Blu-Ray copy you should do so for additional benefit.This reviewer, himself an avid eater of Indian foods, found quite a lot of interesting recipes to try in the future as well as a lot of information nuggets to file away.  This is not a classic reference book nor a classic recipe book but a jolly good hybrid. A sort of informal learning experience. This book really should be considered if you have enjoyed Indian food and wish to learn a little more about it and, hopefully, have an interest to try making some for yourself.The book's very reasonable price makes it a bargain - particularly when you know it will be heavily-discounted by many larger outlets due to the television series tie in, meaning that it is going to be affordable to even more people.

I went to find my local Indian market, and started the very difficult task of shopping where the food is labeled in several languages. (It was worse even, than trying to buy at the Chinese market.) I had a higher proportion of failures than in any other cuisine, and Ramsay's book didn't help. He is a high-end cook, and he tends to \"telegraph\", omitting details he apparently feels should be obvious. I'm a beginning cook, and not all that much is obvious to me! Neither is it helpful, Ramsay, simply to tell readers to buy everything local and fresh. I can't buy any of the fish mentioned local or fresh or frozen.So, overall, if you have a lot of shelf space, already know something about Indian cooking, and enjoyed the TV series, go ahead, buy the book, and enjoy a few extra moments with Ramsay's experience.(Ingredients. Wikipedia has a comprehensive list of Indian ingredients, transliterated. It has been withdrawn (whatever that means), but the person who removed it still has a copy stored, if you click the history.

This style Koontz has been using as of late is very similiar to his Odd Thomas stories.  His words and narration and characters and events seem to be otherworldly or underwater and almost as if we are seeing everything through a light gauze or fog or a narcotic haze. Everything is very dreamlike and soft and as if seen from a distance and is like looking through a slow and blurry lens.  I do like some aspects of his narrative but a whole book like this gets to be tedious and...boring.  Of course, I did not think Breathless would be a fairy tale fantasy story which it is.  Koontz, nevertheless is an excellent writer with his own unique voice and I enjoy some of his writing and his style but the \"otherworldlyness\" starts to put me to sleep.  This story is not very well thought out.  Breathless seems to be more of a meditation of essays and thoughts than a compelling story, more of a dreamlike state than a story with immediatecy and punch.  In fact, this whole story is more of an expanded short story that was cobbled together for 300+ pages with a deadline approaching. Here less would have been more.  This story is just very FLAT and monochromatic with s sudden 100 yard dash to a hurried dis-jointed \"wonderful\" ending and the story strings hardly tie together very well.  I found the first third of the story to be a good beginning and then...it just goes downhill from there.This story is definitely not for everyone.  Especially if you are expecting something like Koontz's earlier and more stimulating stories.  This one ain't it. There also seems to be some science vs. religion thing going on like evolution vs creationism.  I think Dean is in the \"intelligent design\" camp and Darwin takes a beating.I give it a two and a half out of five and I may have over-rated it and I wouldn't recommend this to most readers.  Koontz is a very skilled writer, but despite his writing skills the story suffers.  It's Ok I read it, but I would not read it again and I'll be very cautious before I bother to read any of his newer stories.  I also couldn't find much suspense or thrills but it is somewhat provoking in it's own little fantasy way.  This appears to be his new style and maybe he is worn out from all the suspense and violence of his earlier works.SPOILERS: SPOILERS: SPOILERS:  The Henry character was completely bizarre needless and his only function seems to be for the author to vent about how evil the congress and government and Henry are.  His other function is for some mindless killing off of his twin brother and wife.  The Henry segments are just some filler or fodder which is the same with the Tom Bigger character who is Henry's opposite.  The scientist Lamar who is an emminent chaos theory expert explains the the two cutey-creatures are part of the order of chaos theory and goes on to explain that mathematically...it is impossible for evoltion to be true because not enough time exists for the generations of mutations to create for example...a horse.  And there is not enough fossils found in the fossil record to support said evolution.  So, according to that and chaos theory life forms can simply appear spontaneously all developed and speaking English.  It can only be spontaneous creation or intelligent design??? Oh!  And the human genome and the cutey-creatures are a perfect match.  Aaawww c'mon Dean.  This is all flimsy reasoning.  Especially when one considers that not just two new creatures suddenly appear but some 70,000 pairs suddenly appear worldwide at the same time and they not only understand English--they can also speak it.  I assume the ones in Japan speak Japanese and the ones in France speak French or maybe all of these 140,000 creatures are multi-lingual and probably read and write as well.

So innovative, such skillful young writers, and so productive under their own names and several pen names were they, that some critics postulated that they were in fact a single pseudonymous wunderkind! Over the years, we've learned to recognize their differences, and despite career highs and lows we all have our favorite. Mine has always been Koontz - but with gradually growing reservations.Koontz greatest weakness has been the inability to end a book book with a real, slam-bang climax. We've become used to completing 400 pages of high speed, high energy story telling with half a dozen tepid paragraphs of: \"but it all got better, and everyone went home\". \"Breathless\" definitely exhibits that failure, in aces! Whether alien encounter or divine intervention - and that is not clearly resolved - this story ends with total wet blanket.Over the years, Koontz's stories have started to include greater and greater intrusions of his own right wing philosophies. From boringly repetitive descriptions of both protagonists and villains military-style arsenals, and GlennBeckian rants on societal decline, he has moved on to government tyranny, weird fundamentalist biblical \"science\", and conspiracy theory explanations of the most innocuous groups and institutions (see his fevered \"history\" of that most harmless rural social organization The Grange, in \"The Dead Town\"). Again, all of these elements are present in \"Breathless\", but by now they have ceased to by boring, but easily skipped, asides and have become an essential, unavoidable part of the story. In addition, while Koontz has commonly been noted for strong female characters, active in the story line, in \"Breathless\" the main female character is weak and compliant. There is also a new strain of misogyny which, while usually placed in the mouth, or the mind, of a villain is expressed with a kind of glee that leaves the reader repelled.Despite all of this, I have continued to read Koontz and derive enough pleasure from his inventive story telling, and stylish writing - until \"Breathless\". This book is summed up in my review title - a tragic mess. All of his faults come to a combinatorial climax, in the service of a totally silly premise, a disordered presentation, and some of the worst writing he has ever published. It is hard to decide whether to liken the writing in this book to a cruel lampoon of Koontz, or to the plagiaristic effort of a sad, teenage fanboy. Take you choice, either way it's that bad.In \"Breathless\", one can see Dean Koontz, not as a rival of Steven King, but instead as King-created character, a tragi-comic loser, condemned by his own hubris.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A Tragic Mess", "unixReviewTime": 1359849600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2013"}

This novel does that.Second, I know many readers love the dramatic style of some of DK's novels (Phantoms, for instance, the \"horror\" genre--but for me, I'm sorry, I'd only give Phantoms a 3 star rating.).

Some strange event has happened, and animals have acted in an unusually calm and beautiful manner, which is noted by a vet (our heronine) treating a bunch of seriously abused Golden Retrievers (and, as an aside, I appreciate that Koontz doesn't miss an opportunity to bring into a story the beauty and goodness of these dogs).  Meanwhile, our hero, Grady, and his dog (an Irish wolfhound) have found some very unusual creatures playing in the yard.  He calls the vet and the two of them are amazed and charmed as they realize that these are apparently unique creatures.  The vet emails some other vets, what will happen?  Meanwhile, we also meet a sad burned out bum living in a cave on the beach in California.  The same event that struck the retrievers strikes him.  He feels compelled to travel up the coast.  As he goes, his history unfolds to us.  There are two other characters who I believe are there simply to demonstrate free will.

If you bought a copy, or received it as a gift, just save yourself the time and stick hot pokers in your eyes now, rather than read this and then be forced to do it to distract yourself from the pain of having done so.Mr. Koontz sometimes writes good mysteries and seems to have an uncanny way of portraying a point of view from inside the heads of his savage murderers in a very convincing way.  In fact I would wager that Koontz's villains are probably more entertaining to read about than real murderers would be. I've enjoyed many of his books before, partly for that reason, but more so for the plausible yet surprising way his plots unfold, and his ability to create mystery and suspense without the \"Dan Brown\" method of making you wait three chapters for \"the thing they saw astonished them!\" lurking around a corner.This book, though, is a huge disappointment.  First of all, there are disparate characters who spend the whole book acting separately, although some are drawn together in the last 50 pages in ridiculously unlikely ways.  There is \"What's going to happen next?\" suspense, but since the characters are wandering through the book in subplots that are only woven together randomly in the very last pages, it's impossible to enjoy it.  Also, his characters often act in terribly implausible ways.  One heroic character \"just knows\" it's time to go help someone he has never met, and gets magical assistance from coyotes along the hundreds of miles he walks. One of the villains has an \"experience,\" the nature of which is never explained, which scares him,but not enough to go straight.  Another villain goes slowly insane (out of guilt?...we never learn) after committing a murder he'd been plotting for years.  How disappointing...these are not believable players in the story and their unpredictability spoils the surprises when we see them walk randomly into each others' lives.  Worst of all, though is Koontz's awful, and scientifically bogus, attempt to preach to us about evolution.  This seems to be the gist of the book, unless it's the one summarized by the ending, which is revealed below (spoiler alert!).  No, on second thought, READ THIS SPOILER so you won't be tempted to read the actual book.The book centers around two very intelligent and lovable monkey-like creatures, who in Koontz's speculative fiction, have appeared on the earth spontaneously.  One of his characters, portrayed as an heroic genius mathematician/physicist, spends several pages preaching that evolution is false.  Early in the novel Koontz builds this character's credibility by having him count cards in Vegas and win thousands, but then give the money to needy strangers.  Of course he wanders randomly into the protagonists' lives, and of course there's a remarkable coincidence when he does.  Of course he refuses to cooperate with the evil powers of the central government (for whom he works).  Pretty one-dimensional.  In fact, as I recall not a single one of the characters actually displays any growth during the story.Anyway, our hero mathematician takes time out of the not-so-gripping story to make imbecilic and pedantic statements trashing evolution, such as\"They say, here are the fossils of the horse in various stages of its evolution.  But they're onlyassuming the fossils are related.  These fossils may more likely be of different species, insteadof stages of the same one.  They prove nothing....The assumption that those fossils are arrangedin the correct order...can't be supported with evidence.  Neither carbon dating, nor any methodof fixing the period of a fossil, is precise enough to support that arranged order...Darwinianevolution simply offends me as a mathematician, as it does virtually every mathematician who'sever seriously thought about it.\"There are so many false arguments in this ridiculous train of thought, it's hard to know where to start.  First of all, the simplest evidence of all supports the idea that the simpler forms of the horse precede the more complex ones.  The simple fossils are found at strata of rock UNDER the more complex ones.  They are accompanied by other simple forms, with their more complex forms found above them.  There are many other methods of determining the age of a stratum of rock, and one of them ISN'T carbon dating.  Carbon dating is useful for objects a few thousand years old (such as the bogus religious relic, the Turin Shroud), not hundreds of thousands, millions, or billions.  A reference to carbon dating in this discussion is proof positive that Koontz hasn't actually thought about the science, or had the decency to do even the most superficial research.  A 5-minute phone call would have set him straight.There are hundreds of other methods, but one in particular merits mention, because anyone can understand it: the \"tree ring\" method.  Suppose you used the wood of old furniture as a calendar.  When a growing season is sunny and long, the trees all grow thicker rings.  The opposite when it's overcast and cold.  The rings of a recent tree will have many seasons in common with a tree cut 25 years ago, and another cut 50 years ago, etc.  Sometimes there will be three or four thick rings in a row, sometimes they alternate, and the pattern becomes a fingerprint which goes back hundreds of years.  Wood from objects of known age can be used to date wood of unknown age, because the tree ring pattern will overlap.  Makes sense, right?  This tree ring pattern actually allows us to date ALL wood that is thick enough, back several thousand years.  Now it's not too hard to see how that analogy applies to the sedimentary layers of oceans, dry lakebeds, and then core samples from all the strata.  Not just the thickness, but also the chemical composition of the strata correlate to many known events in the geologic record, like the meteor that struck 65 million years ago and rendered the dinosaurs extinct (it left a layer of iridium all over the earth).  There are  many more.  And they may not be precise to the millisecond, but they are very precise with regard to the order in which the strata were lain down.  The order is very precise.And guess what?  In no case has paleontology ever found a simple fossil in a stratum of rock earlier than a more complex form of the same animal.  Never, not even once.  No messy exceptions to explain.  Now I don't think this alone will convince you to accept Darwinian evolution, but it must make one thing absolutely crystal clear: there is plentiful fossil evidence to support the concept.  Anyone who says there isn't is either ignorant, or knows about the evidence and is a contemptible liar.  I doubt the author is completely ignorant.Of course, Lamar, the mathematician, doesn't have a better explanation, he just lets us assume that God created all the animals.  His views aren't consistent with the fiercest fundamentalists, though, as he goes on to describe the earth as billions of years old in another erroneous argument that there hasn't been enough time in the history of the universe to evolve genes as complex as a worm's.  Still more proof that Koontz is not rigorous; current evolutionary biology theory indicates that a genome as complex as the human one mutates fast enough to change every DNA base pair it contains every 1.1 million years or so.  Given the infinite power of natural selection to weed out the detrimental genes and reinforce the advantageous genes, and one has to be amazed at how slowly more complex forms arise from simpler ones.  Bottom line: there's been time on earth to evolve humans, or any other form of life on earth, several thousand times over.  Saying otherwise is either...well, you get the idea.Back to the super-monkeys...we never learn where they come from (they just appear out of the thin air);  why they're here (but their appearances change people, but only some of them); Koontz imagines their genome is decoded in mere hours (using today's best technology, it would take months to years), they start talking with 20 pages left in the book (and they speak in a very wise way, like they are supposed to be teaching us things), but worst of all, their DNA matches humans' exactly.  This last offense to all rational thought absolutely shatters Koontz's credibility on any scientific topic.  Not that I trusted him to get any of it right in the first place, but ladies and gentlemen, if two genomes are a perfect match then they are from the same species.  Koontz really proves he is a cretin of science with this naive twist of fiction.  Saying two different species have the same genome is like saying that two colors of light have the same wavelength, or that two samples of the same element have different atomic numbers.  It is so far from possible that it's dishonest to imply that it COULD be possible by having one of your characters speak it in a book.  Shame on you, Dean.In one of the worst endings I have ever read, Koontz fails to explain the appearance of tens of thousands of these mystical super monkeys all over planet earth.  We're left assuming that they are some supernatural intervention, sent to save us from ourselves.  The closing line, a response to the  question about the super-monkeys' purpose on earth, is: \"Wherever they're going, they're taking the world with them.  And I know beyond doubt that wherever they want us to be, that's where we'll belong.\"  I literally laughed out loud at the absurdity of that drivel.  It instantly made me think of the line from the movie Buckaroo Banzai, among Peter Weller's more brilliant deadpans, \"No matter where you go, there you are.\"  There we are indeed where we belong after reading your latest effort, Mr. Koontz.

His imagination moves even the stoic naysayer, and his exploration of the paranormal is a literary event in itself in this tale that weaves together many seemingly unrelated stories of terror, hardship and agony.BREATHLESS begins in rural Colorado with an unassuming character named Grady Adams and his dog, Merlin. An enormous Irish wolfhound, Merlin established superiority in his domain by his size alone, notwithstanding his gentle nature. Today, the man and his canine friend stroll at the edge of Grady's property into the nearby woods. Both suddenly halt, thunderstruck by the sight directly ahead. They witness two white furry animals the size of medium dogs but agile as large cats. Playful, the two allow man and dog to approach, then turn away and head to the forest.Adams and his longtime friend and neighbor, Cammy Rivers, are enchanted with Merlin's new-found playmates as the white creatures now make Grady's place their home. But sinister events shake up the fragile status quo when outside influences assert a nasty presence.Rivers, who is a veterinarian, also has her own tale when she is called to treat a kennel of abused golden retrievers. The dogs, catatonic when brought in by a rescue group, will be a challenge to heal. However, when Cammy arrives, an event has occurred that cannot be explained by medicine. The dogs stand as one unit as if listening to a common, emerging sound, no longer timid and completely socialized. In addition, their eyes glow with a bright topaz inner light, and this inexplicable event may just spell certain doom for the small town.Koontz writes a third story also set in Colorado, that of rural resident James Carlyle, wife Nora, and identical twin brother Henry Rouvroy. Henry, a Harvard-educated savant, arrives at Jim's farm, bent on executing a plan he has long developed. Country poems, Jim's haiku verses in particular, foreshadow the agony his twin brings to the humble farm.A scenario in Las Vegas introduces Dr. Lamar Woolsey, a scientist studying chaos. Taking small bets to major wins at the Vegas tables, this card shark gifts his winnings to others, puzzling the pit bosses. A conference in Denver forces him to leave Vegas, but along the way his attentions are quickly diverted to a U.S. government project that just may have something to do with the strange occurrences in the once quiet Colorado town.Koontz then takes us a little more west to California for the starting point of Tom Bigger's story. Bigger is a homeless man, his face horribly disfigured and living on the beach in sheltered caves. When a great blue heron nearly five feet tall brushes past him, he sees the event as a sign for his future and sets out walking with his backpack on a journey east to a future unknown.Readers will long to discover the common thread that winds through these seemingly disparate stories. Although it appears unlikely at first, Koontz is able to satisfy his audience by presenting a believable connection that brings all these stories together for an enjoyable --- and plausible --- conclusion.

His other novels are incredibly detailed stories of suspense that really draw you in. This story seemed to be more of a relaxing visit with a favorite relative rather than the thrill rides we're used to.It all starts out a little overwhelming at times as you are introduced to several characters that gradually develop into their own plot lines that seems completely independent of each other. Hang on though, as it all makes sense toward the end. By the end, I mean the VERY end (next to last chapter). It seems like an intertwined short story collection, which is a unique way to present the book. I found myself truly interested as certain parts played out, though the end result of the \"twins\" storyline was a huge letdown. It was the best of the whole book, and then just fizzled out in the end.I would give this story 3 1/2 stars if possible. It's definitely not Koontz's best work (or even in his Top 10), but it's still better than many of the other novels out there. If you're an established reader, you're going to find this a much more laid-back book than say \"Intensity\" or \"Odd Thomas\".

All of the \"good\" or righteous characters not only abstain from sex, they abhor it.  Any love relationships that take place he always makes sure that the characters have a pure, true, \"untainted\" love and makes sure to say it.  Any sexuality at all is for only the bad guys.  It is 100% negative, rape, incest and so on.  It is really disturbing.  And my last gripe?  We get it Dean, dogs are great. The greatest thing ever. WAYYYYYYY better than people. MOVE ON.

Later, Grady contacts his friend Cammy, a veterinarian who has herself witnessed some strange phenomena.  Together, the two will try to understand the implications of these new animals, as the government moves in to take them away.The opening scene is one of the most compelling Koontz has crafted in years; the prose is brisk and sharp, he puts you right there with Grady.  If the novel had stuck with Grady and Cammy, this would be a compelling read.  Unfortunately, BREATHLESS is an overly-ambitious novel, one that doesn't have the depth to fulfill its goals.  I lost count of how many central characters we have, some of them introduced in the last 150 pages, and some of them dropped with no explanation.  None of them (Grady and Cammy included) have any real depth.  We get everyone from a gambling mathematician to a sociopath, and none of them feel real or relatable.  The psychopath fits the exact profile of every Koontz villain from the mid-90s on; he contains every cliched trait of serial killers, and yet none of the humanity that makes such characters truly terrifying.  He's a cartoon, almost, a caricature, as are all the characters here, big and small, human and canine and what-have-you.  This is one of Koontz's \"message\" novels--the government is bad, animals are good, and former Army Rangers who turn to secluded lives in the wilderness automatically have hearts of gold--and deals not with plot, not with character, not with anything that used to make a Koontz novel worthwhile; it deals with goal, message, spiritual motivation.  Nothing is at stake here, because we don't care about these people.  We don't even care about the plot-twist; while interesting, it comes way too late (the last 50 pages) to be of any importance, and isn't at all fleshed out enough to be believable.Still, BREATHLESS is suspenseful; I actually finished it, which is more than I can say for a few of Koontz's recent efforts.  Admittedly, I only read it because it was given to me as a Christmas gift; while I treasure Koontz older works--say, up to the first ODD THOMAS--and consider Koontz one of my favorite writers, I really have no interest in reading his newer novels.  They are all flat, driven by some desire he has to deliver a message to his readers.  It's a shame, because he is genuinely one of the most talented suspense writers out there, who used to endow his writing with so much poignancy and craft, I could read the same novel twice in a row and not get bored.  Today, his novels read almost like parodies, and BREATHLESS, while not the worst of the bunch--at least none of the animals turn into literal angels, only metaphoric ones--is representative of this drastic decline.  Any Koontz novel that uses the phrase \"oscillating butt whistle\" in a half-serious manner is almost a travesty.  I will stick to his older novels--WATCHERS, STRANGERS, WINTER MOON, etc.--that deal with similar themes and ideas as BREATHLESS; back then, Koontz was willing to put story and plot development first, and message second.  It was more effective and far more entertaining.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A novel about chaos and \"the innocence of the earth\"", "unixReviewTime": 1261958400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2009"}

It could easily have been shortened to a novella and still regain all of the main ingredients. And it wasn't too cute or dog-ish, which I'd certainly expected.But let me start off by saying, I'm not religious, I do believe in more than meets the eye, but I can't really believe that evolution is wrong. Maybe there are some holes here and there, but I think that there's enough proof to back up, that evolution is, indeed, fact. I'm not saying we know it all, as it is clear that there are tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of things yet to be discovered.Overall the book entertained me and I was never really bored with it - except, maybe, for the Henry parts, I really didn't find them interesting or particularly well-written. They didn't seem to belong in this story - and no, don't say that I didn't \"get it\", it's entirely possible to get it and still don't think that it fits.I really liked the story of Tom Bigger the best, would have loved to read a whole novel about him.Also, why does it seem, in all his later books, that unless a couple is married, people are asexual?

Of course there have been novels I didn't care for over the years (From the Corner of His Eye) to page turners I couldn't put down (Odd Thomas), but even when Koontz put out a book I didn't care for, I could still appreciate the author's writing style, or the characters he's created, in short there was always something positive to be found tucked inside the pages. Until now.\"Breathless\" is simply head-scratchingly boring. There is truly nothing to recommend about this novel. The characters are bland, the mystery is simply goofy and side stories seem tacked on for filler (really..what is the point of introducing the wealthy lawyer, who takes up a few chapters only to never be seen again?) The story doesn't flow like a Dean Koontz story as elements to the tale seem crowbared in, so many square pegs pounded into round holes.The basic premise about a country vet and former Army ranger befriending two unusual animals discovered in the Colorado woods was too corny for words. I know Koontz can sometimes layer on the schmaltz a bit thick now and again...but several parts of this novel made me cringe at just how cheezy it was getting. The whole scene when Puzzle and Riddle are preparing to go to bed or eating jalapeno peppers is just....awful. Koontz shoehorns in a couple killers here or their impact on the story is minimal, and as stated above just feels like so much filler.The only positive I can say about \"Breathless\" is that it's a quick read.

However, the book is incredibly disjointed and seems to recycle some of the \"wonderment\" of a few of his other books.Mr. Koontz usually develops compelling characters. Grady and his wolfhound Merlin are interesting, but you don't find out what really makes the man tick or get a sense of the dog's deep abiding nobility. InWatchers, as Koontz develops the story you find out why Travis Cornell is the man he is and why the heroine, Nora Devon, is the woman she is and why she is able to become the strong, independent character ready to protect her family. The dog's personality is well fleshed out. In Breathless, Koontz doesn't fully develop Grady, Merlin (the wolfhound) or the veternarian, Cammy Rivers. One of the most developed characters is Harold, but you still lack the why as to why he killed his twin.Two of the most interesting characters are Puzzle and Riddle. The ending though leaves an incomplete sense about their presence. The question of why the goldens became happy and the farm animals looked into the mist for 15 minutes is never really fully answered. The various subplots don't gel towards the end either. Koontz introduces several characters and quite frankly at the end of the book you have to ask \"why\" were they even in the book.And to go back to one of my great loves--the Irish Wolfhound, Merlin's character development was also a bit of a disappointment. Wolfhounds are one of the quirkiest dogs around. They have an unique view of life and although Merlin was presented well, his character could have had more depth. I believe I read in an interview that Mr. Koontz does like the wolfhound, not as much as golden retrievers, but the dog is up there in his affections. Not sure he has ever owned one after reading the book. For instance Merlin obeys Grady the way a golden would obey a human.  I can't think of one wolfhound I have had or have known that is as obedient as Merlin is in the book. When you ask them to do something their 'obedience' sometimes is rather interesting.So I give the book three stars for the wolfhound, the limited character development of Grady, and for the mystery of Puzzle and Riddle which quite frankly will leave you puzzled and riddled!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I'm not sure what to say...", "unixReviewTime": 1261699200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2009"}

The two beings around which the main story progresses, Puzzle and Riddle, are exactly that.  Their nature and origin begins as a mystery that drives the plot along.  The story is told through several vignettes that don't appear to be related but have a wonderful synchronism to them.  We are introduced to a handful of classically Koontz characters, that is to say, very unique.  The vagrant on a mission, the chaos theory expert, a homicidal psychopath, the works.  The book is quite suspenseful, ending just about every chapter on some sort of cliff hanger and switching to another parallel event, leaving us always itching to get back to the one we were just on.  Of course, guessing the origin of Puzzle and Riddle was always in the back of my head but I was joyously surprised that none of my theories were correct.  The book is full of imagination and takes the road less travelled.  No cookie-cutter revelations here.  As with all great literature, Koontz may step on some toes here with some of his ideas, but that is as it should be.  Several reviewers have complained that Merlin, one of the main character's dogs, plays too prominent a role.  I found Merlin to be well characterized for anyone who knows and likes dogs while not being overplayed into the story.  As usual, Koontz hits the right notes with his human characters as well.  Some are likable, others not.  Some are abominable, deliciously abominable.  I refer here to those murderous characters who are so ill-suited to the real world as to be darkly comical.  They provide a good deal of the more humorous moments in the book which I always like about Koontz' writings.  The author's philosophy seems to shine through and offer an uplifting viewpoint that serves to encourage us all.  Moving between the stories sets a good pace that keeps you coming back for more.

Despite that, I was ready for \"Breathless\" to break the trend of formulaic books that Koontz has put out over the past few years. From \"The Husband\" to \"The Good Guy\" to \"Relentless,\" it has seemed we were getting different variations of the same story. This, I thought, might break that mold.It breaks the mold, all right. It dives deeply into the chaos theory that some of Koontz's characters defend. \"Breathless\" starts with the same feel as \"The Taking,\" showing mysterious events and creating a palpable sense of intrigue. We meet Grady Adams and his dog, Merlin, as they start spotting some inexplicable white creatures in the woods. Through the eyes of Camilia Rivers, we see horses and even goats start acting in odd ways. And we meet a coldhearted killer named Henry Rouvroy, who is more than he seems. We are introduced to others, as well, and the book begins to feel more like a series of short stories than a cohesive unit. Nevertheless, I kept waiting for things to swing around, to sprint into action.With thirty pages left, though, I was still wondering when this chaos theory would gel into something like a full-length novel. The plot threads that at first seemed to be winding toward something deep, instead meandered, tangled, and knotted. The characters' goals and motives remained nebulous through most of the story, and Koontz tacked on a preachy section, as has become his routine of late.Koontz is an undisputed master of narrative. I like his ideas, his questions, his searching. His dialogue is great. But these pieces must fit together to make a great novel, and this doesn't seem to happen here.Once again, I am left feeling cheated by the genius that I know Koontz possesses.

Frightened by what he has seen, he and his Irish Wolfhound Merlin race home.At the same time on a horse farm, veterinarian Dr. Camilla Rivers is shook by what she sees.  All the horses seem in some sort of trance as if they sense something big is coming.Grady calls Cammy to come over to his house to look at something strange.

Instead something familiar can be the wicked and those with ethics will step up to prevent the heinous from inheriting the earth.  The creatures slowly reveal who they are to their adopted human pets, which makes Grady and Cammy even more resolute to keep them safe.

Loner heroes who have screwed up childhoods. And of course the dogs in every story. This one even had a dog on the cover. That aside my biggest problem was there was no real conflict in this book. And without conflict you don't have much of a story. It seemed to be more of a morality tale. Which is fine if dont right but it just seeemed heavy handed. I know Kontz is a religious man and I am as well. But there seems to be a general tone in his books that we are all headed to hell if we do not repent.

The novel follows multiple characters, the upright moral ones, the seedy ones with struggling consciences, the deranged antagonist impeding on the protagonists' trail, and the various other characters that add flavor to the plot of the story.  Even though the story has its formulaic tendencies, it does have entertainment value and offers an optimistic view of the future of humankind.The story builds up to centrally focus on the existence of two exceptional beings--such as to suggest that humanity is on the brink of a new era.  The novel deals with this concept in a skilled manner--though way too late.  The first half of the book seems a bit trivial, to the point of bringing me to near boredom.  The storyline of the deranged antagonists, one a twin brother with grotesque intentions and the other a demented wanderer--doesn't seem to really add anything to the story.  It wasn't until I was over halfway through the book that the there was edge and suspense to keep me reading.  I was left wishing that the book could have developed more of the storyline dealing with the veterinarian Cammy and her friend Grady, who ultimately befriend and protect the beings, who we learn a little too late, are the central characters in the story.Despite the shortcomings of the book, late development and frivolous storylines, the last quarter of the book makes worthwhile reading.

Each person is presented separately, intriguingly, and then in the final part of the novel most are merged together in a moving and lively crescendo.There is the seemingly peaceful furniture maker Grady Adams and his dog Merlin. Grady has a hidden past. There is Camillia Rivers, a dedicated veterinarian with a tragic past of her own. She recues two dozen dogs that are in a state of shock because of dehydration, malnutrition, maltreatment and disease at a puppy mill. After being saved and at her kennel, the dogs suddenly stand, as if they are listening to a distant message, one that humans cannot hear. Then, after moments of stupor, they become healthy, as if they were never mistreated.There are the two strange animals, if we dare call them that. They come to Grady Adam's house and made it their home. The two seem to change before his eyes and do things that no animal can do.There is also Henry Rouvoy, who embezzled millions of dollars, who kills his twin brother and his wife so that he can assume his brother's identity. Although dead, the couple seems to continue to inhabit their home, as in Edgar Allan Poe's Tell Tale Heart.Dr. Lamar Woolsey also appears.

Wallace wants Rudy Neems to kill his wife by burning her. Wallace agrees that Neems can rape her repeatedly before the murder. Tom Bigger is also introduced. He robs people with an empty gun because he does not want to hurt anyone; that is, anyone but himself. His face is hideously disfigured because of beatings. He is searching for something or someone.There are more characters in this magical symphony, each adding his and her own notes, including the sweet tones of Josef Yurashalmi and his desire to do gemilut chesed and the discordant sounds of Paul Jardine, the villain from Homeland Security.Readers will enjoy hearing how these characters encounter and interact with one another.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a magical symphony", "unixReviewTime": 1264377600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2010"}

As they welcome these mysterious animals into their home, they soon discover that their arrival coincides with a wondrous event that will forever change their lives and millions of other all over the world.Dean Koontz never seems ceases to astonish me with the amount of tricks up his sleeve. Each installment in his illustrious career is unique and otherworldly, with Breathless being no exception. In recent offerings Koontz has come under fire, unfairly so in my opinion, for not being the same guy who once scared us around every turn with evil characters and harrowing plots. Lately, dogs have become main characters more than usual, and for whatever reason a lot of fans and critics alike have not looked kindly upon his change of style. In a bold and effective move, Koontz sticks it to the doubters and transforms familiar elements in a way we never imagined.Not only is Man's Best Friend featured in Breathless, but in this story animals play a bigger role than most of, if not all, Koontz's previous works.  However, fans who feel like they have been missing out will be pleased to know that this is one of the most suspenseful novels Koontz has written in a while, with a fast paced plot laced with just the right amount of dread, wonder, and redemption. We're even treated to some frightening and disturbing scenes that will have many readers looking under their beds and in their closets long after reading. Once again Koontz`s prose and dialogue are delivered at the highest level as we follow several storylines to a powerful conclusion.In the end we are left with a poignant glimpse into the beauty of nature and the mystery of life and the wonder that connects them.  I love what Koontz has done of late, and I particularly love what he's given us here.

In fact you'd be hard pressed to name a worse one altough there are unfortunatley quite a few really bad novels by \"modern era Koontz\" competing for that title.What has happened to the Dean Koontz who created some of the best thrillers ever written such asIntensity,Night Chills,Mr. Murder,Watchersand other classics? Go back and pick up one of those old books, basically if you're buying novels published around they years they were first were released and not reprints you're looking for ones where Dean on the back cover is almost bald.  His standard of writing has gone down since he bought a wig, hair transplants, or who knows what but it looks a bit ridiculous and isn't fooling anyone, since he put on the wig, he's come up with maybe one or two good books. In fact I wouldn't be suprised if the real Koontz retired and sold his name to some other writer who just isn't anywhere near his standard? Or if it is him, has he just lost the ability to write great novels? Got too much pressure from publishers to churn out too many books a year? Suffered from writers' block for a decade or two?  Who knows, give Breathless a miss or at the very least borrow it from your local library before paying money for it.Basic plots of Breathless (and there isn't just one, the book is basically a heap of short stories with paper thin tying together at the end if Dean bothers to at all which he doesn't with a few) are - Social hermit and his dog spot some strange creatures in the woods and find out intruders are messing around inside and outside their house.  A vet who is only a vet for the love of animals is coming across bizarre behaviour from animals brought to her clinic (of course Golden Retrievers, Dean is obsessed with these things and includes them in every book written in the modern Koontz era) and others animals she goes to visit. The most interesting one but story that goes nowhere, a man visits his twin brother and wife with a suitcase full of stolen money and a head full of psychopathic fantasies involving abducting women.  A homeless self face mutilating man gets the urge to move on even though he doesn't know where he's going.  A serial killer who only kills attractive women is approached by his lawyer to do a job.  A mathematician is on a winning streak in a number of casinos.  Sounds interesting, well Koontz never develops any of these storylines to contain any great substance.  Throw in an extremist religious propaganda speech about how evolution is wrong and just a lot of uneducated mindless waffling on, Golden Retrievers ridiculously used as examples of size differences between male and female animals in a conversation when more obvious animals would have been used.  Unnecessary flashbacks of abuse of characters in their childhood that serve no purpose in the plot and a heap of other things, that as I say you'd be breathless if you named each and every one, contribute to Breathless ranking up there with not only the worst ever Koontz novel, but worst ever novel by any author of all time!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "You Could Go On and On About How Bad This Book is Until You Were Completely Out of Breath!", "unixReviewTime": 1261094400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2009"}

The creatures are unlike anything he's ever seen - about the size of mid-size dogs but nimble as cats, and possessing the most beautiful fur coat he's ever seen.  A veterinarian friend, Cammy, doesn't know what they are either.  Soon they realize they're not the only ones interested in these unusual animals.  Meanwhile, a mountain-poet neighbor, Jim, receives a visit from his long estranged twin brother who kills him, intending to assume his life.This book seems to be an adjective-heavy blend of many other stories.  There were shades of Michael Crichton'sSphere, and the efforts to save the creatures reminded me ofE.T.(although not as exciting).  There were also allusions to Poe's Tell-Tale Heart and even Freddy Krueger.  The strong, silent, reclusive, troubled hero Grady bears a strong similarity to Tom Clancy'sJohn Kelly/Clarkor maybe a hermit-version of Clive Cussler'sDirk Pitt, while the vulnerable and emotionally damaged Cammy is pretty much a stock female character.  Other characters feel like they're lifted directly from the slime-ball of the week in the many nauseating crime dramas that have proliferated on television.  Oh, and then there's the genius chaos-theoretician (who uses his talents to cheat casinos and gives the money to desperate and down-on-their-luck folks) - I think we've seen that character a few times.  And perhaps only slightly more annoying is that Koontz liberally adds characters and subplots as the story progresses - err, stumbles along - and nearly all are flat and add little to the story (the dog's only role seems to just be a warm-furry).

There are some interesting, though somewhat formulaic plotlines woven throughout, and some of the characters start off as intriguing. Then the book begins to spiral downward ever so slowly, and the author becomes positively self indulgent.Clearly, the author has some very strong opinions with respect to governmental agencies, defense attorneys, elected officials, and so on. The author makes his rants part of the story but, somehow, it feels like...well...rants by a survivalist or far right wing ideologue of some kind.Still, the story does have some steam. It revolves around two strange, white furred creatures that come to earth and are discovered by a reclusive man who lives with his Irish wolfhound in rural Colorado. So, this does grip the reader's imagination. After all, what are they? What do they want? Why are they here? Unfortunately, the reader will never really know.Add to this the fact that that the characters, while initially intriguing, seem to be one dimensional. They are either god's angels on earth or the devil's spawn. There is no in between. Thematically, the book seems to be about good and evil, but it never really finds its groove.Still, none of these shortcomings are what eventually torpedoes the book. It is the race to the finish line and the unsatisfying end to the story that does it in. A reader may endure some of the shortcomings along the way to the finish line but will feel decidedly cheated by the rushed feel of the ending and the lack of some rhyme or reason as to why some characters were included in the first place. The book has an almost nonsensical ending that is decidedly unsatisfying.I am a fan of the author, so I was quite disappointed and let down by the turn the book took, as I know that the author is capable of delivering more than he did.

There were simply way too many plot threads present. Even though he attempted to draw them together in the end, many just had no real relevance.Each thread, while peopled with interesting characters, still brings nothing to the main plot. I believe that Koontz was attempting to contrast good and evil here, but it appeared more like he was trying to use this book as a dumping ground for some of his unused character and plot ideas.The main plot thread featuring the two creatures should have had more follow through and explanation.Character Development: 2 StarsI think if you have never read a Koontz book, you will enjoy the characters. However, having read every one of his previous novels, I found his characters to be overdone, cookie-cutter copies from his earlier works.We have the woman who was abused as a child (not sexually, because that's a bit much for Koontz to ever handle, regardless of how much more common it is in real life), who nevertheless has a heart of gold, even though it's hard for her to trust people. We have the guy she does trust because he is such a...well...trustworthy guy. We have the smart, intuitive dog, a given for Koontz. We have the evil sociopath. We have the giant, ugly guy who looks scary, but also has a great heart to remind us not to judge based on appearances.Judging solely from this novel, the characters are two-dimensional and shallow.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing style was of Koontz' usual quality. In other words, it was excellent.

I fully intended to listen to the entire book on audio within a matter of days. As soon as I was hooked I knew that listening to the audio was just going to take too darn long.

He introduces them to his veterinarian friend, Cammy Rivers. They share wonder over these new animal friends. Meanwhile, we see other stories emerge within the first chapters: an identical twin travels cross-country to kill his twin brother so that he can assume his life then encounters his own version of the Tell Tale Heart; a disfigured man who has hidden himself from others and drugged and drank himself into oblivion begins a quest with an uncertain end; a middle-aged gambler with a broken heart and an intellect that allows him to count cards and win against multiple card decks, yet he gives all of his winnings away to deserving people he meets along the way. Early in the story you begin to question what one story has to do with the other.

I enjoy the way he puts words together and the energy of his pacing.  When it comes to dialogue, he's got a definite ear for the way people speak.  He's been in the writing business for a long time, and his passion is always clear.  Primarily, he's known for his thrillers lately, but those readers also embrace his \"feel good\" novels.For these kinds of books, Koontz usually plays his characters as innocents caught up in a macabre web involving criminals and heavy-handed bureaucrats with sinister agendas.  That's what Koontz was going for it in his latest book, Breathless, but somewhere along the way he dropped the ball with this one.Oh, there are innocents aplenty.  The book opens with Grady Adams, a small time furniture maker living life at a slow pace with his wonder dog, Merlin.  I actually thought the opening was very reminiscent to the opening pages of an earlier Koontz book, Watchers.  Even the creepy noises and things that happened out in the forest seemed to echo that book.Then there is Camille Rivers, the local veterinarian who has basically pledged her life to the protection of animals.  Other than her medical practice, Cammie seems to have no life.  Sadly, that really comes across in these pages as well.The two main characters, our heroes, seemed to be shadows of Koontz's normal characters.  They never quite came to life for me in the novel.  There were bits and flashes that were really done well, but the book just bounced around too much for them to take hold.  I really believed Grady was going to be our go-to guy for this novel, but it was like he got edged out by Cammie, who ultimately didn't do much at all.I can't say that this is a suspense novel in the truest sense.  There was no chase, no sense of impending doom, no ticking clock.  Curiosity propelled me through the pages more than anything else.  I wanted to find out more about Puzzle and Riddle, two amazing animals that showed up in the pages.  Unfortunately, that didn't turn out as well as I'd have liked either.  Koontz raised a lot of questions with his story, which is what writers are supposed to do, but he never got around to answering them.Another semi-hero character is a casino-gambling mathematician who is an expert in chaos theory.  We ended up getting more page coverage of his gambling in casinos than in his insight into the mysterious animals.  It was like he was dropped in at the right moment to explain everything to our heroes, who didn't really have a clue.  And he was tied to our heroes by the thinnest threat woven out of left field.Then there was a villain, a bad guy that didn't have anything to do it Puzzle and Riddle at all.  I read through several pages of him worrying that the brother he had murdered had come back for revenge.  That concept never went anywhere either.Rounding out the cast is a homeless guy named Tom who never meets anyone else in the book.  I didn't understand that subplot at all.  I know it was supposed to tie into the arrival of the mysterious creatures and the fact that the world as we knew it evidently changed, but I just didn't feel like much had changed by the end of the book.I think the concept had a lot of promise.  The whole idea of how things and creatures are created was deep, but Koontz only skims the surface of what might actually have taken place if these events had occurred.  I wanted more.

{"reviewerID": "A2B6KXVPG2APXV", "asin": "0007267622", "reviewerName": "Michael Davey", "helpful": [4, 9], "reviewText": "I like Koontz books because they tend to be light, as in the opposite of dark. They make me feel good. The good guys win. The bad guys (usually) fail. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoy dark books (John Connolly) but its nice to read a book where not everyone is a murderous bloodthirsty killer (even the good guys) (Dexter, Lee Child's Jack Reacher).But what I have a problem with Koontz books is his tendency of late to slant towards a rightwing Fox News version of reality with a cast of characters that are one dimensional, stereotypical villains and heroes. For example:Lately, murderous bloodthirsty villains have been university graduates that eat and drink 'high end' food. ie, your typical liberal bottled water drinking arugula eating elites. Whereas the heroes have been salt of the earth meat and potatoes eating heartland folks who work with their hands. I notice that Koontz doesn't mention that Harvard has an excellent veterinary program. I guess Cammy, the troubled woman heroine veterinarian in \"Breathless\" must of sprang from the ether, a fully qualified vet.Again, in this novel, the evil elected government officials are deliberately trying to destroy their own society (you know, the one that pays their salary and pensions)It seems in his latest novels, Koontz only knows about elected officials who are out to destroy the world so they can remake it in their image. He's never heard of the many that work 10 or 12 hour days only to be harassed day and night by his constituents and the press who believe they have the right to poke in every nook and corner of his/her life.Only those characters who know and love god are decent people. You won't find paedophile priests in a newer Dean Koontz novel. You won't find a duplicitous hypocritical bible thumper in a later Dean Koontz novel.The sad fact is, Koontz's characters are simple, one dimensional cookie cutter characters, each cut out from the same dough. The damaged woman. The damaged man. At least one has a dog that is so spectacularly special it picks up its own poop, wraps it up and puts it in the garbage.WARNING: PLOT GIVEAWAYIn this particular novel Koontz demolishes the theory of evolution through math. Life, apparently is simply too complex, DNA, is too complex to have formed in the amount of time that it has. DNA in even lower forms of life has too many nucleotides to have been created by chance or evolution in the six billion years since the earth started. Since the simplest forms have 250,000 nucleotides, the small changes could not have been made in time. It has to have been god. It is made very clear in the dialogue. Except, of course, that it simply isn't true.Mutations, when the happen, happen to small and large structures that make up DNA. After all, down syndrome results in a person with an extra chromosome, which itself contains between 500 and 40,000 genes.But this isn't my problem with this book. My problem is this book, and his others have become far too simplistic, almost as if he had developed a main plot that he simply plugs in new characters, then rolls a dice to come up with random situations to flesh out the book. Each book is very much like the last, each character interchangeable with the characters in the last.His characters have become a joke in their simplicity. Especially the villains. They are simplistic to the point of absurdity.In the end, I find myself wondering if Koontz is lobotomizing his books in an attempt to write to a certain audience, the Fox News viewers, viewers who watch Glenn Beck. People who don't care about depth of character, shades of grey or seeing the world for how it really is, but people who only want to see what they want to see. They don't want anything to change, they don't really want to understand things, they only want their world view to be authenticated, simply and quickly.They want their heroes to be god fearing, meat and potato eating, work with their hands type people. They are so good they never stray, they never have a bad thought, they don't leave brown stains in their underwear. These people are just so gosh darned good that they aren't even human. They are like nobody on earth.The people Koontz is writing too don't want to read or know about people who are conflicted, they don't want to know that most people are more than just black or white, that the terms left or right wing don't really encompass the majority of Americans, that some people who call themselves liberal own guns, that some church people believe a woman shouldn't have to die in childbirth, or bear her rapist child. They don't want to have to deal with any complicated problems or ethical dilemmas.In other words, what I liked about Dean Koontz's books was that every once and a while they were simple and easy to read and they left me feeling good. But they have become too simple. They have become simple to the point of WWII propaganda. Even worse, simple to the point of Fox News simple.Now thats simple. One dimensional. Propaganda.Of course, you don't have to read it. I probably won't again.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "getting pretty much the same", "unixReviewTime": 1261267200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2009"}

Look, Mr. Koontz: There's a reason why evolution is taught in public schools and is endorsed by almost all scientists: Because there are facts to back it up.  The whole of science backs it up (read Richard Dawkin's recent book, THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH).  You see, Dean, we don't believe in things because they are pretty, or fun, or make us feel good... we go where the evidence leads.  If you have evidence for creationism, then by all means document it and publish it in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, don't preach it in a novel.  But there are no intelligent design articles published in those places precisely because there IS NO evidence for ID.Even for a Dean Koontz fan such as myself, this is simply too much BS to swallow even in fiction.

But it might sound the death knell for his status as an A-lister. This could be the one that finally drives away his remaining fans still clinging on from his 1980s horror days and even his middle period (circa the Chris Snow novels) and leaves Koontz as a must-read only among his religious and political sympathizers - and of course the golden retriever crowd.There's almost nothing about it that worked. The human characters were uninteresting and mostly lacked humor. The only exception to that was one newcomer to the book's Colorado setting who experienced some trademark Koontz dark humor shocks. This character's story never went anywhere or linked up with what little overall plot there is, but that's all to the good here. The other major human characters mostly don't interact with each other either, except for the predictable single sensitive male and his female counterpart.I specified human characters because of course there is a canine one as well, plus two of what I can only think of as Ewoks. They're soft and cuddly and have big soulful eyes. That's how we know they're good! I do wonder that a man of Koontz's age, experience, and religious sensibilities loses all ability for rational thought when it comes to animals - real or imaginary.I found the pacing of the book extremely annoying. Koontz switches point of view every thousand words or so, which is bad enough as it keeps the reader from ever really settling into a scene. He amplifies this problem by starting a new chapter every time. This relatively short novel had 72 chapters. That's a lot of white space. I would have found it less distracting if he'd for instance kept the chapters to 18 with four sections in each, separated by a blank line is as common.I had the feeling that either Koontz or the publisher structured the novel the way they did in order to make the finished product seem longer than it is. If Koontz is having trouble writing two novels a year, there's no shame in that. That's a heck of a pace for a novelist to keep up year after year. Maybe he should get together with his editor and restructure his schedule, so that instead of his having to deliver a novel every six months he has whatever time he needs - even if that means he only puts out a book every nine months or once a year.In any case, I think he'd better take a good hard look at why he's writing. It can't be for the money, so he must still feel he has important things to offer. If so, I'd like to hear some of them - assuming they pertain to the human condition as opposed to the retriever, wolfhound, or Ewok one. The proper study of man is mankind, Dean.

Some of his books have unforgettable plots, characters, and mystery. A few miss one or more of those. \"Breathless\" lacks all three. As usual, he starts to create a mystery but quickly falls back into colorful description of scenery, people and moods. Count how often he uses color related words such as copper, gold, silver, blue, etc etc etc to describe the sky, the grass, the road, the twilight, a meadow, yadda yadda, yadda. Koontz must get royalties from Crayola.Once again, he uses a dog as a featured star but this dog lacks the charisma and talent of his dogs in some of his great past novels (i.e.-Watchers). This dog, an Irish Wolfhound and his master seem bewildered about the happenings around them. Mainly, the appearance of two unusual creatures which Koontz describes endlessly without ever creating a true vision for the reader.Then, he throws in a lunatic, a card counter, a vet, a killer and various supporting characters who come and go and never create a real sense of being.Endless dialog about chaos theory, man's fear of new evolution and plot lines that wander to and fro without a worthy climax and you have a total mess.I read every Koontz book and often buy them. I am glad I did not buy this novel because it bored the heck out of me when confusion and boredom reigned.His last book \"Relentless\" was much better and he has written lots of great stuff but this is not worthy of this fine writer. If this were the first Koontz book I ever read, I would probably dismiss him as a confused writer unable to create interest. It's not.

What are they? Where do they come from? And why are they here? These are the questions that drive the novel. Unfortunately, these questions are only partially answered in the hurried conclusion of the book.I am a BIG Koontz fan, having read him since back in the seventies. He is a brilliant writer and parts of this novel are so well written, they do, in fact, leave you breathless, especially the scenes involving Grady, his dog Merlin, veterinarian Cammy Rivers, and the creatures she names Puzzle and Riddle. However, this is a multiple viewpoint tale, and the reader spends time with many other characters, including a man seeking out his twin brother, a man intent on winning money and giving it away, a lawyer hiring a hit man to kill his wife, and several others. Unfortunately, none of these characters were as interesting as Cammy and Grady and I found myself bored as I read their scenes, counting the pages until I got back to the main characters.Of course, all these characters are tied in to the main story line by the end - sort of -- but the pacing was distorted, derailing the usual Koontz thrill ride. Even the book cover contributed to this awkward pacing. The cover stated \"Wonders still exist in the world. But not if Homeland Security has anything to do with it.\" This promises a suspenseful chase type of a novel, but Homeland Security doesn't enter the story until almost two-thirds of the way through, and the \"chase\" is almost non-existent.I feel this is one of Koontz's weaker novels, but a weaker Koontz is still much better than fifty percent of the books I read.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Left Me -- Confused", "unixReviewTime": 1341619200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2012"}

While Koontz is not a stranger to using animals in his stories, Breathless stands everything else on its head.Grady Adams is a simple man; a carpenter/craftsman who manages to provide for himself and his Irish Wolf-hound, Merlin, while working out of a converted barn.  Living a relatively isolated life in the mountains of Colorado is perfect for Grady.  One day, while exploring Grady stumbles onto two creatures unlike any he has ever seen.  At first, he is unable to approach them before they flee.  Over a few days though, he gains their trust and, the story is on. In time Homeland Security and the Army become forces that Grady and his friends must deal with.  Let's just say the story is captivating and once you're hooked you won't regret picking up the book.I hate to use the phrase \"typical Koontz\" when discussing any of his works because that implies every story is the same.  One thing is for sure that over the years Koontz's books have been anything but typical.  I know this is a clich&eacute; but most of his recent books seem to open to the reader like you peel an onion.  One layer after the other is revealed until the climax is reached. You may even tear up a long the way.Breathless is a great story packed with suspense, great character development, and fantastic descriptions.Long time readers appreciate Koontz's ability to tell a good story and also touch the reader in a special way.

It is classic Dean Koontz with a couple of good guys and lots of bad guys. Not sure how to describe the plot other than to say that some new creatures show up in the world and somehow make the world a better place. Kind of like society winning the \"goodness\" lottery or something. Smooth writing, interesting people, fanciful but glorious purpose, and demonstration of justice do not make up for what is essentially an average book and an odd retelling of E.T.Players: The bad brother who killed his own brother and sister-in-law goes nuts as the book progresses. The ugly hitchhiking dude actually improves and becomes a better person. The evil government people realize they are over-reacting, and the man who hires his wife and son to be killed...not sure what happens to him. He sees something that he can't stop thinking about. The brilliant scientist philanthropist, after giving away lots of money, has some perceptive insights into the new creatures. The ex-assassin and veterinarian (a victim of abuse who ended up killing her own step-father) are the wise ones who embrace the wonder and goodness of the creatures.All these things come together to make for a fun, easy to read book. The writing is smooth and the stories are interesting to a point. You will hate the ones you should hate and like the ones you should like. You will especially like the dog and the creatures, and the positive tone of the book comes shining through by the end.But the evil is dark and disturbing and we are not real sure what happens to all the people presented. Somehow the puzzle pieces don't all seem to form a picture and by the end, the reader has a hard time being emotionally connected to the events.

He experiences some strange, hardly wonderful, incidents at his brother's place.Miles away, Tom Bigger, an alcoholic vagrant, witnesses something miraculous and is compelled to return to his childhood home, even if it means he must walk for days.In Las Vegas, Dr. Lamar Woolsey stops to gamble on his way to Denver for a conference, but never makes it. Instead, he is ordered by a high powered government agency for which he sometimes works to board a government transport to rural Colorado.Near Seattle, attorney Liddon Wallace hires a former client to murder his wife and son in California.Dr. Rivers' well-meaning consultation about Grady's beings with two colleagues brings the worst of the federal government to Colorado.Grady's beings are charming, delightful creations. Each of the characters has an interesting story, and by the end of the book Koontz connects all of them in some way to the beings Grady and Merlin meet. But the connections are, in cases, a bit too loose and unfinished to make them truly satisfying. Subplots could be tightened and connected more strongly to the mystery presented in the main plot. The book seems to both wander too far afield at times. It might enhance the plot if more focus and resolution were included, particularly in sections dealing with Liddon Wallace. The book seems not quit whole in many ways, as if it isn't quite finished. Unsatisfying.\"Breathless\" confronts  scientific and government rigidity and over reaction. The book has little patience for science presented as dogma. But that theme, too, might be better served if a bit more resolution or expansion of what happens after the climax were included.Several statement made by some of the characters are well worth thinking about, however.  For example: \"When a scientist tells you that 'the science i settled' in regard to any subject,\" Lamar said, \"he's ceased to be a scientist, and he's become an evangelist for one cult or another. The entire history of science is that nothing in science is ever settled. New discoveries are continuously made, and they upend old certainties.\"I enjoyed reading this book, but I wanted more.

They become a \"perfect storm\" of sorts, and often lead to an amazing novel.Unfortunately, BREATHLESS, by Dean Koontz, doesn't meld separate ideas into a perfect storm.  The result is more like...a perfect train wreck.Let me state, for the record, that I actually enjoy some the stories that Koontz writes.  I can appreciate the transition he made into straight-forward thrillers that he has published recently (VELOCITY, THE GOOD GUY, THE HUSBAND).  Personally, I enjoyed ODD THOMAS.  Are they the best novels?  No.  Do they serve a purpose in my reading schedule?  Definitely.  Every now-and-again I need light reading.  Dean Koontz usually can usually fill that role.But BREATHLESS?  Man.  It was just bad.Surely you can hear the built-in marketing campaign that comes with the title of the novel?  The new Dean Koontz novel will leave you...BREATHLESS!  How I wish that were true.  Bored?  Check.  Bewildered (in the bad way)?  Check.  Disappointed?  Double-check.  Breathless?  Not even close...unless you count the aftermath of my screaming in frustration at having to finish this book.BREATHLESS starts out fine...good even.  We are introduced to a few characters that are decent, and that are put in interesting situations.  The main inciting event deals with Grady Adams, an ex-military type, and his dog, Merlin (it's a Dean Koontz novel, of course the PoV has a dog), as they discover a pair of unexplainable animals in the field by their (Adams' and his dog's) home.  I don't want to go into it too much, because the mystery behind these animals is the driving force of the story--well, what little of it there is.  We also are introduced to Camillia Rivers, a local veterinarian with a dark past (are there any other kind in a Koontz novel?), who also gets involved with these two mystery animals.  For the mandatory Dean Koontz creepy character, we get Henry.  His opening chapters were great.  All of this stays entertaining for approximately 100 pages.And then we meander.  Endlessly.The pasts of the characters, rather than actually adding to the story, are just there as filler.  They don't actually influence anything.  Being paper-thin would be an improvement over what we get here.  As we move along, we are introduced to more characters that serve no purpose in the story, and whose resolutions are solved with Deus Ex Machina.  On character in particular, Tom Bigger, reminded me instantly of the characters I hated in Stephen King's THE STAND.  You know, the ones that wander endlessly.  Doing nothing.Kind of like the last two-thirds of this novel I am reviewing.The realization I came to upon finishing the novel, is that this was just a conglomerate of unrelated novellas and short stories that are forced together through contrived, thin plot threads.  Henry's story meets with that of Grady and Camilla for a whole paragraph.  Tom's never meets that of the main characters (his resolution is the Deus Ex).  It was infuriating, to say the least.The writing?  It was your typical Dean Koontz.  If you like his writing style, then you will like the writing style of BREATHLESS.  The book itself will probably only be enjoyed by the most die-hard Koontz fans, and even then it's no sure-thing.BREATHLESS just isn't good.  The idea is marginally interesting.  The characters are worse than paper-thin.  The cohesion between plot-threads is absurd where it even exists at all.  The ending is anti-climatic and rushed.  This should have been a novel to grab new readers, but instead it will push them away.The good news?  I only paid $8 for the hardback due to the ridiculous Amazon vs. Walmart price war (huzzah!).  And no, it still wasn't worth it (booooooo!).  Also, this isn't typical of Dean Koontz.  BREATHLESS is an aberration.  I fully expect a new novel shortly that will get him back on-track.  At least I hope this will be the case.  I need my simple novels after reading guys like the awesome Erikson.That said, don't read BREATHLESS.  It just isn't worth it.

The characters in this book have no substance, their histories exist merely to link them to each other.Even worse some character arcs are totally redundant (unless I missed some deep symbolism which is always possible) Tom Bigger is introduced halfway through the novel, with the only purpose to prevent a murder commited by two other characters also only introduced later in the novel (and seemingly totally unrelated to the plot about the mysterious creatures)The author also spends too much time on The Senator, whose story arc consists of killing his twin brother, being responsible for the death of a sniper in the past then blowing himself to smithereens with grenades after going (or becoming more) insane. While The Senator is related to the main protanganists there is little point to the amount of page-time he gets.The scenes of the novel meander, as the characters don't have goals. We have little tension as we don't really know the point and certainly don't care about the mystery creatures except to find out WTF they are (I still didn't care for them after either)The evolution thingThe novel has a few poor pokes at the theory of evolution throughout, namely suggesting that the theory hasn't had the widespread impact on layman of other theories (whose fault is that the Theory's or the layman?), and a jab about the complexity of the mystery creatures eyes (for those who don't know the complexity of the eye organ is held up as evidence for creationism as eyes are too complex to evolve)but the true awesomeness (awesomeness in terms of making me laugh at the lameness) a 'genius' chaos theory experts tries to discredit the theory of evolution claiming its mathmatically impossible.His points.There are not enough moments in history to lead to life - apparently the age of the universe is 20 billion years, and the earth even younger (10,000 years perhaps).In truth no-one really knows just how many moments you would need for life to develop, and this isn't an argument either way because of this.The fossil record is bung, and so is carbon dating.

That's basically the only thing that redeems it though. But the problems start with the character Henry. Henry is easily the most interesting sub plot in the whole book and his story never develops. It begins he kills his brother and sister-in-law and \"takes over his life\". But he never leaves the house after that other than to go to his car and nothing that surprising happens in his story. When it ends with him actually pretending to be Jim and not knowing it the reader does not have a mind blown feeling because nothing that profound happens before then. That's the first major problem.The second major problem is that of the sub plot of Tom. Tom's story is actually decently interesting but in all honesty his character and therefore all characters actually linked to his story are entirely unnecessary. His whole purpose in the main plot is to reveal that the creatures appear out of thin air but this could be revealed in many different ways that would not require Tom. Without Tom you also no longer need the woman he saves, her son, her husband that hires a hit-man to kill them, the hit-man himself, Tom's parents, or the Jewish couple that try to help Tom find his family.The third and most important problem is that the main story is just not all that exciting. Each time I found myself coming back to the story following Grady, Cammy, and the two creatures I knew it was going to be just another chapter claiming how \"amazing\" they were. When it starts they are interesting but after a while it starts to drone on.End Spoilers**In conclusion most of the story seems unnecessary while parts that would be interesting seem like they were taken out or forcibly made shorter.

The end result is entertaining -- for while Koontz is ultimately a moralistic writer, he also happens to be a highly intelligent and imaginative one.Whether you like BREATHLESS depends on what you're looking for.  Readers seeking a tightly written storyline will no doubt be disappointed.  This novel meanders a lot, and is dragged down by a number of pointless subplots.  Koontz follows a stream-of-consciouness approach to plotting these days, and that approach's shortcomings are painfully evident here.Still, I really enjoyed BREATHLESS.  It contains a lot of great little moments, and there are individual scenes that are exciting, touching and even brilliantly written.  If Koontz has structured the plot better, BREATHLESS could have been a great novel, instead of a highly uneven one.So while BREATHLESS is far from perfect, fans who enjoy Koontz's new writing style (and philosophy of life) should enjoy what he serves up here.

It is a fine piece in what i call the second age of Koontz.  I began reading Dean Koontz and Stephen King when they both arrived on the scene many decades ago and watched as they were often compared for their ability to induce fear, stimulate chills, and make us hear bumps-in-the-night.  Although both have naturally undergone tremendous growth as they have matured, Koontz especially seems to have entered a second age where he has abandoned the scare-your-pants-off horror and the depravities of society for a more mellow, otherworldly spiritualism where animals, especially dogs, play significant roles in human lives and mankind's stability.He now writes more stories and plots about hope and inspiration, about goodness flourishing and defeating the forces of evil and darkness.  Some longtime readers have had difficulty embracing the new Koontz and his sense of wonderment and his morality plays where goodness and integrity always defeat absolute evil.  Yet, Koontz remains a sterling wordsmith who can turn a phrase into a mind picture or select the right word to make an image real to the reader.  He remains adept at evoking emotions and manipulating the reader's conscience and interest.In \"Breathless\", Grady Adams and his wonderful Irish wolfhound, Merlin, make an incredible discovery of a life form that will conceivably change the future of the world.  After confiding in his friend, Camilla Rivers, a local vet, they find themselves pawns as all the force of the US government through Homeland Security have them imprisoned in their own home while implicitly suggesting these awe-inspiring discoveries may be subjected to vivisection and governmental cover-up.  This is where the real suspense begins as they search for ways to rescue their discoveries and share them with the world.There are 3 separate subplots that unfold in a back and forth rendering in \"Breathess\" that sometimes disturbs the pacing and continuity of the main action; furthermore, although all the threads ultimately intersect in a hurried ending, some are only tangentially related to the main plot.  Some of this subtext seems mere reinforcement for the good vs. evil conflict in Koontz' universe.This is a difficult book to evaluate for this reader.  It is well written and certainly heart fulfilling in the end.  However, it feels more like an extended short story or novella.  The pacing is uneven and many of the myriad characters in the novel are only shallowly fleshed for the reader.  Many questions about motivation, strange occurences with the minor characters, and the existence of these new life forms are disappointingly unexplained.

The overreaching theme throughout the book is evolution; some may think it's about good guys and bad guys, but those are just subplots for the larger issue.The reason that Koontz fails is that he spends about a page summing up what the entire book is about: that the evolution of any species simply can't occur in the time spans proposed by biologists. He makes a very good argument from the point of view of a character, a mathematician, and even makes it clear that they aren't talking about creationism either. If you choose to find the answer by the reading the book, the answer can be heard in the form of a thud. That is the sound of the author dropping the ball like a lead weight.He marries together about 6 different plots, with so many coincidences that Dickens must be rolling over in his grave. I can say without being dishonest that I found myself turning the pages to see where all this was leading, which unfortunately wasn't anywhere exciting.The ending was typical Koontz, with the male lead becoming more than just friends with the female lead (whom I thought might turn out to be the first main lesbian character in one of his books, but that'd be too much too ask). And of course, there is the perfunctory dog. A staple in most of his books now. Anyone who hasn't figured out that Koontz is a California conservative hasn't been paying attention to the evolution of *his* books.Now Koontz is a very good writer and he can staple together a sentence like few people can. He can ratchet up the tension and make you believe the impossible. That didn't happen with Breathless.He does take a good swipe at the old trope, \"the science is settled,\" that you hear so often lately about global warming. Here he's referring to evolution. His argument against that type of thinking, that science is never truly settled, was refreshing to read especially in this day and age when the mainstream media spends copious amounts of time convincing us the science is settled on this and that. Until a new study comes out.I hope he writes a sequel if only to explore this spartan story even more: did the creatures come from a parallel universe? an alternate reality? how did they come to have the same genome as humans?

But sadly, it seems that with the demand for him to churn out more and more books, he's lost some creativity, as well as the ability to conclude a story well.I've noticed a lot of character name repeats from one book to another (example: in one book a human is named Tessa, in another book a dog is named Tessa, characters in multiple books with the last name \"Booker\"). Now I can appreciate if Koontz just has favorite names that he enjoys resurrecting, but from the reader's perspective, it comes across like \"Seriously? He couldn't have thought up a new name?\"There's also the all-too-predictable storyline of someone who's a cop, ex-cop, or ex-military being one of the protagonists. OK. I can live with that. The female protag's are always the same. Strong, independent, 99.9% of the time coming from some tragic background that they had to overcome. They're also always both single, which ensures romantic/sexual scenes, or at least tension. Too bad the real world isn't as full of 30-40 year old, independent, resourceful, good-looking single people.The dialogue is always the same, especially among the inevitable male/female protagonists. They're always witty. No one's ever of average intelligence, or of a reticent nature. Conversations are always rapid-fire, intelligent, full of speculation and flowery vocabulary. No one takes more than a few minutes to overcome shock or horror. When something in the storyline leaves us aghast, somehow the characters just need to exchange a few brilliant quips and the story moves right along, leaving little time for reflection or musing. Or contrary-wise, the characters will launch into 3-page-long introspectives that still leave no time for reflection or musing.This book, \"Breathless\" follows all the aforementioned rules. It also repeats another of Koontz's favorite characters (a good-natured, intelligent dog), though I was glad to see he strayed from the usual Laborador/Golden Retriever and went with one of my favorite breeds, an Irish wolfhound. There was also a strong echo from \"Watchers\" (about a genetically enhanced, super-intelligent dog who can communicate with people), in the characters of Puzzle and Riddle (evolutionary-enhanced, super-intelligent creatures who can communicate with people). Honestly, I much preferred them in their more mysterious forms presented early on. Once they started talking...it was just too corny to enjoy them after that.I also sensed what others have mentioned - that the multiple storylines were held out too long, and wrapped up far too hastily. When I realized that I had very little book left to read, and the climax hadn't happened yet, I knew it was going to be like this. You can't wrap up half a dozen individual storylines in a few pages. Well, you can, but it's messy and confusing. And we never get an explanation for what happens between Tom coming to his parent's home (where it's obvious his parents aren't living) and then suddenly he's sitting with his parents outside a retirement home. What?All in all, it's a typical Koontz book. Enjoyable for passing the time, fun characters, great suspense and mystery early on, lots of page-turning wonderment.

BREATHLESS is a readable book that pulled me in, but ultimately it did not satisfy me for a number of reasons.First, the subplots, though engaging at first, have very little to do with the ending.  The various plot threads involving ancillary characters come together so quickly at the end that one then realizes that many of the chapters devoted to these characters were unnecessary.  The sense of suspense is therefore completely deflated at the end as the reader feels cheated at having waded through so much prose.And therein lies another major fault with this book.  Even when we focus on the main characters, the ending is so abrupt that the reader gets no closure on a plot that has dragged on for over three hundred pages.  Once a writer gets you to care about his characters, he has an obligation to let you know how the protagonists feel about the events they have lived through.  As in most Koontz novels, it doesn't happen here either.There is, of course, the characteristic repetition of phrases and ideas one finds in most of Koontz's fiction.  He refers endlessly to the moon-frosted meadows, and his descriptions of the landscape become absolutely tedious.By far the biggest problem is that the plot resolution hinges on Koontz injecting what appears to be the narrator's own philosophical (and quite ludicrous) beliefs into the plot in order to explain the mysterious going-ons throughout the book.  His science is so inaccurate that I almost quit the book with forty pages to go.Koontz has great ideas and is capable of giving us a tighter narrative with a tougher prose style.  This book could have been told as a novella or very long short story, but as usual, Koontz novels keep rolling off the assembly line.  He could write much better fiction if he took a deep breath and decided to put some meat on the bone.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A Novella Stretched into a Novel", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}

Wilson \"W.Wilson\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "This is the second Dean Koontz book that I've read.While reading it, I was impressed by how much better his writing has gotten over the years. Koontz really has become better at his craft: his writing incorporates more of a poetic sensibility, he carefully draws parallels between scenes, and he's not afraid of incorporating dark humor and satire.I was particularly impressed by the development of the character Henry Rouvroy. I like the way that Henry's story begins so innocently, then ever so gradually turns deeply sinister. For example, (spoiler warnings if you haven't read it) Henry looks forward to seeing his twin brother, James, but he frets that James might not be as interested in seeing him. (Side note: \"Henry James\" is, of course, the famous writer of the psychological thriller, _The Turn of the Screw._) In the beginning Henry's looking forward to seeing his twin seems genuine and heartfelt. But this gradually turns evil, and we see Henry's mind become exposed as an extremely dark, psychotic entity. As a psychopath, Henry sees only evil intent in the most innocent things and intentions. Unlike the universe of the heroes of the book, which expands delightfully, Henry's universe contracts to a farmhouse that he's ruthlessly taken over, and is a dead end.Koontz lampoons Rouvroy well, calling into question his so-called intellectualism and \"cultured\" tastes. I particularly liked the use of the alliterative words \"rectal recital\" that Henry gives upon waking from his nap, the nap that was induced by Henry's rotted mind having become so overwhelmed by the singular genius of his favorite intellectuals of the modern age. (One of whom is \"the Madonna that is Ciccone\"!) I'm not sure why Bertolt Brecht made the list of Henry's favorites. Guess only Koontz knows why...But Henry isn't the only one who gets lampooned: Jim and Nora's life on the homestead, however wholesome, is still a bit too perfect. For example, I think of the scene in which Nora advises Henry to ride one of the horses along with Jim to a certain spot in the area because \"the world is never so right as it seems then.\" (Gack! Did she really say that?)Koontz also evokes the horror master Poe in the scenes where Henry is apparently not alone in the house and hears the \"rap-rap-rapping\" out of the \"meter\" of his dead (?) brother poet-farmer James in the attic. Just who else, if anyone, is in the house? Is Henry schizophrenic, and is he playing the dual role of his evil self and his good twin James?I guess I differ from some of the reviewers here because I like the way that not everything is spelled out in the story, the way that some things are left in shadows.I do, however, believe that the story lines for Henry and the evil lawyer (Liddon Wallace) were played out.Possibly the ending felt rushed for some readers. It didn't bother me so much because there are some damn fine sentences within these covers.Again, this book was a pleasant surprise for me, and I'll likely be checking out some of Koontz's other, more recent work.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pleasantly Surprised by Its Cleverness and Development", "unixReviewTime": 1263945600, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2010"}

Lots of lovely words strung together, with no real story to go along with them.Breathless has a little bit of that.  Cammy Rivers is a vet haunted by a vicious past.  Grady Adams is a war vet haunted by the loss of his best friend.  These two characters remind me a bit of the central characters from Watchers.  One night they are greeted by a mysterious pair of...animals?  Along the way we get glimpses of a homeless man with a good heart, a lawyer with an evil one, and a man driven insane by a grave mistake.  BUT, what we aren't given is a compelling story.I go back to Watchers.  Koontz wove a strong story about a genetically altered golden retriever on the run from...something else.  He meets a kind man, and together they meet a lonely woman, and the three of them embark on a journey.  But there is a story there, there is a reason for their journey.  You root for the characters in that book, you want them to succeed, to fall in love and to triumph over evil.Breathless gives us small glimpses of a wonderful story, but the glimpses are just too small to elevate this book above 'just ok.'  The end could have been powerful, but it just seemed to stop.  Do Grady and Cammy fall in love?  What is the deal with the mysterious pair of animals?  Are they animals?

While his previous novels moved at breakneck speeds, contained a good measure of character development, plot twists and a mix of both violence and action, nearly all of his books from the last 3 years have continued their long and boring descent into lackluster stories. Since \"The Husband\" (A novel that had great premise but, surprisingly at the time, fell flat on its face with over-wrought exposition and a strange menagerie of unbelievable characters and wholly weak ending) Koontz focus has shifted. No longer are we grabbed and taken through sometimes dark (\"The Taking\") and sometimes humorous (\"Life Expectancy\") great works of fiction, but rather we are subjected to long passages of exposition, and Koontz's failing ability to craft a suspense/thriller/horror novel into a book that tries to find beauty in everything.Unfortunately, \"Breathless\" stands (so far) as Koontz's weakest novel yet. And it's a shame really, because I was excited at the prospect of a new book by \"one of the most important novelists writing today.\" Sure, he may be important (nearly all of his books from the last 6 or 7 years have made it to the New York Times Bestseller list) but it doesn't change the fact that if keeps churning out \"suspense\" novels so lackluster and depressing in scope, he's going to lose a good percentage of his fan base.There was so many things wrong with \"Breathless\" that its hard to pin-point the exact things. First were the characters. Koontz has always had a great talent with different people throughout his novels. But not now. Not one single person (Henry, Cammy, Tom Bigger, Lamar, Rudy) was believable or even easy to relate to. And half of those characters really shouldn't have even had any page time as they were utterly pointless. There is a story that made little to no sense. Side stories that had nothing to do with the actual bulk of the novel, far too many \"bad\" guys with the EXACT same problems, a plot twist that I figured out within the first 50 pages, and a conclusion that was so anti-climactic and boring that I was actually rather upset I had wasted any money whatsoever on this novel.I suppose even a 2 star rating is rather high for such a disappointing novel, but I have to give Koontz credit for the way he was able to bring everything to a close (even if it was a lame ending).So, yes, I am glad I read this book (as it adds to my ever growing library of Koontz) but I only recommend it for that reason alone.

Its inhabitants have been waiting for it to move through the dimensional barrier once again and into the world of Deverry and the Westfolks.  This happens as Angmar's eldest son Enj gives the ruined trumpet to the dragon Rori who gives it to a powerful dweomor user.  Valanrdorio appeals to the spirit of the Lady of the North upon Earth to fix it which she does.  Enj blows it and the island returns home.Their world is a different place than the one Argmar left.  Her husband Jori is a dragon who secures the inhabitants' lands to make sure the Horsekin don't lay seige to the populated towns in their religious zeal to convert everyone to the cult of the goddess Alshandra.  Jori isn't sure he wants to be turned into a human and since the Horsekin plan to invade, the rulers can use an ally like him in his dragon form.  People are fleeing their homes because they are not safe from Horsekin raids. The islanders wonder what will become of them in this new world with its war strategies, new alliances and the threat of the Horsekin invading their lands.The third Silver Wyrm tale has many more subplots than written above as almost every character has something going on, which can overwhelm the reader with switching perspectives.  Laz the thief is the most fascinating of the vast cast as he landed on the island to escape punishment for stealing magical gems.  He has one chance left to make amends by righting wrongs and eliminating much of the bad karma he caused over several lifetimes.  His chance for redemption depends on the choices he makes; readers will wonder which way he goes as Jori and the people of Haen Marn return home in THE SHADOW ISLE.

{"reviewerID": "AGKPTMTR3UX1R", "asin": "0007268939", "reviewerName": "Konrei \"Everything I need is right here\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \"Sword and Sorcery,\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work, and Katharine Kerr's, falls under the rubric of \"High Fantasy,\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls. The good Professor, an Oxford Don whose specialty was Philology, would be proud of Ms. Kerr, who puts her own fascinating and lively spin on the old myths.The prolific Katharine Kerr taps into the ancient Celtic traditions to create the world of Annwn (literally meaning \"Nowhere\" in Welsh), an incredibly detailed, incredibly graphic land of the imagination filled with lost mountains, far valleys, and towns and villages whose denizens, most unknowingly, exist in a world filled with \"Dweomer.\"\"Dwimmer,\" meaning \"magic\" or \"sorcery,\" is an ancient English word, probably derived from the original Brythonic language spoken by the Celtic Britons in pre-Roman times. Likewise, \"cwm\" or \"coombe,\" meaning \"valley,\" appears only on Great British maps, the first variant being Welsh and the other Old English. \"Weird\" is a modern English word which means \"bizarre,\" but it derives from the earlier word \"weirding,\" a term applied to occultists who were supposedly able to alter fate.Kerr's representational humans are descendants of European Continental Celts (Gauls), an historic people made up of numerous tribes who were decimated and dominated by the Roman legions commanded by Julius Caesar, circa 50 B.C. According to Kerr's mythology, the tribe living in the invented Gaulish Kingdom Devetia Riga was magically transported to Annwn, where they established the Kingdom of Deverry.In keeping with ancient Celtic beliefs, Kerr crafts her epic in the form of an Eternal Knot. Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series withThe Bristling Wood, book number three, should bring you right up to THE SHADOW ISLE. However, given the numerous storylines and recurring characters in different incarnations that have developed over the course of fourteen novels so far, it's far easier to read the books in sequence (and you're advised to ignore the separate cycles, which do not really stand alone). THE SHADOW ISLE is the fourteenth book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry series, and is book three of \"The Silver Wyrm Cycle,\" the fourth and concluding cycle in the saga.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, Jill's preincarnation.Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.THE SHADOW ISLE begins with an interesting turn. Haen Marn, the Shadow Isle of the title is a dweomer island, occupied by dwarves. It has, to this point, played a minor role in the saga, but in this eponymous book, Kerr gives it it's due.Haen Marn vanished from Annwn when the Horsekin raids began some sixty years ago, rematerializing in the very earthly country of medieval Alba. For those of us who are not Celticists, Alba (or Alban) is the ancient Celtic name for Scotland. The Albans seem entirely nonplussed by the appearance of the dweomer island, assuming it came from Cymru (Wales) because of the language its odd inhabitants speak. For the denizens of Haen Marn, Alba seems Deverry-like, but they are bewildered by the cult of the sheep worshippers---at least that's their assumption about the Holy Lamb of God. Kerr, like all authors, can't resist the obligatory inside jokes that propel all storytelling. The hoped-for return of Haen Marn to Annwn may well be the first sign that peace is returning, in what has become essentially a world war.The Elves, after a thousand year long nomadic existence, are beginning to settle in towns, and there is talk of returning to their ancient cities if only the Horsekin raids can be stopped.In Deverry, things are taking dark turns. Although the Deverrians and their allies manage to defeat the invading Horsekin in set battles, their victories have not blunted the Horsekin appetite for raiding, pillaging, slaughter and slavetaking.Neb and Branna continue to study dweomer, though Neb is fixated on his past life as Nevyn. Considering himself the world's greatest dweomermaster returned, he begins to condescend to his teachers, and in his attempt to recover all of Nevyn's vast knowledge, he takes steps that may or may not lead him away from the Light.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's \"Deverry\" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here. Kerr seems to delight in coming up with more and more outrageous expletive phraseology, my favorite of which is, \"By the scaly underside of a dragon's ... !\"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote like the restrained University Don he was. Middle Earth has the vertical intellectual airiness of the dreaming spires of Oxford. Kerr writes like the Rust Belt native that she is. Working-class Deverry spills horizontally off the pages in an entertaining flood, which is why it took fifteen full novels to tell the tale.The individual plotlines of the Deverry storylines are straightforward rather than rococo, with just a few curves here and there. There's not a lot of mystery here, not a lot of unanswered questions, and any resolution of suspense tends to be pretty much what you'd predict. In the end, the reader has to keep track of more than enough incarnations and karmic twists that the addition of diversionary plot elements within the stories themselves probably would have had the average reader screaming.THE SHADOW ISLE is very much a \"transitional\" book. Nothing begins or ends here, despite the idea of some readers that THE SHADOW ISLE would end the series. Rather, it's a bridge to the concluding book of the Deverry Saga,The Silver Mage.Although THE SHADOW ISLE isn't able to stand alone, the quality of Kerr's writing continues to reach the same high standards it has evolved toward over the twenty years it took her to write the series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For this reason there are angels that die and are renewed---The Kabbalah", "unixReviewTime": 1341705600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2012"}

He is surprised and confused when he is immediately summoned to New York City, with no time to pack or make other arrangements for his trip, and no explanation.  When he arrives, he quickly learns that his friend and colleague Evangeline Prowse was the victim of a brutal murder, and before her death requested Carson personally investigate the crime.Dr. Prowse was the director of a mental institution in Alabama that housed many violently insane criminals, included Carson's brother, Jeremy Ridgecliff.  Carson had gone to great lengths to conceal the fact that he is Jeremy's brother, including changing his name and erasing a lot of his family history, including the extremely violent death of his abusive father, killed by Jeremy.  Very few people knew his secret, and Dr. Prowse and Harry were two of them.Carson was not warmly welcomed by the NYPD, who suspect his is nothing more than a hick detective, and treated him accordingly.  Carson soon discovers he has a huge secret to keep: the suspected killer of Dr. Prowse is Jeremy, and he seems to be tormenting the citizens of New York.As the investigation continues, the NYPD detectives warm up to Carson, slowly, but begin to trust him and his advice.  However, when NY detective and Caron's new love interest Alice Folger goes missing, presumably taken by Jeremy, Carson has to protect Jeremy to keep Alice alive.  He soon discovers a way to contact Jeremy to learn more than he could have imagined: Jeremy is not guilty of killing Dr. Prowse, nor did he kill the many people he was accused of killing many years ago.  Instead, it was another man, a former police officer who investigated the death of Carson's and Jeremy's father, and now he is hunting Alice.This is a great story by Jack Kerley.  Although it is his fifth completed book featuring Carson Ryder, it is only the fourth published.  It tells a great story, and sets the stage for the possibility of Carson moving to New York City.  Carson is a wonderfully developed character, with uncertainty, charm, secrets to keep, and very likeable.  In this book Jeremy takes a different turn, not guilty of the killing of the many people he was accused of killing, disgusted by murder, not able to stomach it.  However, in at least one of the previous novels, Jeremy took great pleasure in causing Carson pain, seemingly in conflict to who he was in this book.

Perhaps because he fails to write a good story, Kerley's representation of schizophrenia verges on Nazism, and the final scene of the story leaves acceptable suspension of disbelief about 5 leagues behind.The worst thing about Blood Brother is while reading it, one can't help but be aware of what the book is trying to be, it's trying to be politcally relevant. it's trying to be psychological, its trying to have a compelling (probably hoping for a reusable) main character, and in case you haven't been paying attention to this review Blood Brother fails on all counts.Rant over.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Digging deep for something good to say about this book....

He is shocked to discover the owner, beautiful art gallery owner, Alexandra Wijkner, dead in the bathtub of frozen water. The first person he encounters on the street when he runs out for help, is Erica Falck, the victim's childhood friend, a writer who came back to Fj&auml;llbacka to sort out the household after her parents' tragic death. After reporting Alex's death to the police, Erica finds herself emotionally drawn to the case and her persistence leads to the solution of the crime and many striking discoveries. Also, the young detective, Patrik Hedstrom, is Erica's and Alex's school friend, who always had a sweet spot for Erica... So, there is also an element of romance.\"The Ice Princess\" is the first of the \"Patrik Hedstrom\" series. I am very curious how he does as a star detective in the later books, because here, although nice, he is still a bit boyish and nave (although intelligent, empathetic and sensitive, very desirable traits in a detective). I think that advertising this novel as similar to the Larsson and Mankell novels was unfair (aside from the fact, that the Millennium and the Wallander series have nothing in common but the setting and a wide social background). \"the Ice Princess\" is more of a classic mystery set in a close, remote community, with its charms and limitations. The characters are drawn with bold lines, there is a lot of black-and-white, and the social background concentrates more on the relationships between the inhabitants of the area. Not so many nuances and complications. More like theatre. Nevertheless, it is a good novel, I read it with pleasure and I will continue reading the series.

Erica is under a heavy load, feeling herself at a crossroad. So it's a pleasant surprise when she reconnects with another friend from her childhood, police detective Patrik Hedstrom, who's looking into the suicide.This series of books features the relationship of writer Falck and detective Hedstrom, and in this debut we see them getting to know each other as adults. There are quite a few characters, and I had to take notes, though I don't mind that. I thought the premise was very good and the characters interesting. The characters were not, however, deep or intriguing. The pace was dull at times. At nearly 400 pages, it could have benefited from an editor's touch. We got lots of detail about people's actions, but I didn't feel we ever got any deeper into their psyches, even the two major characters, Patrik and Erica. Late in the book when Erica finds out various truths and secrets, she tells us she's &#34;so angry&#34;, but that's as deep as it goes. Hmm. I am hoping that the next books in the series will be more revelatory. The ending of several story threads felt rushed, and some weren't addressed at all.

{"reviewerID": "A1HBC0NBQJHT7X", "asin": "0007269854", "reviewerName": "Bookphile", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Stieg Larsson first introduced me to the wonder of Scandinavian murder mystery writers, and my horizons were further expanded by reading some Henning Mankell and Jo Nesbo.  I've become such a fan of these writers, that I immediately snapped this book up when I saw it, hoping for more of the same.  Larsson isn't the world's best writer in that his prose can be clunky, but he excels at lighting a fuse and then dropping bombs on his readers.  Mankell's work can be just as pulse-pounding, but his prose is more polished.  Nesbo writes with great skill about the psychology of his main character.  Unfortunatly for Lackberg, she doesn't quite live up to these standards.  Still, as I read, I couldn't help feeling that maybe she was on to something and that, with time and polish, her work could become just as compelling.One of the major problems in this novel, in my opinion, is an excess of minor plot threads.  The main murder plot was an interesting one, and I was engrossed in unraveling the entire story behind the murder.  I also thought the back story of the alcoholic painter (whose name escapes me) was interesting.  There was some potential to the plot with Erica's sister, Anna, but it felt tacked on to me.  I had the impression that the author wanted to insert an important issue into her plot, but I just didn't feel it was fully developed.  I think that the fact that it has nothing to do whatsoever with the main murder plot also gave me the feeling that it had been tacked on.Related to this is Lackberg's choice to tell the story from shifting perspectives.  I don't mind books with shifting narratives, but I don't like it when an author makes the choice not to write from an omniscient point of view, but then feels the need to tell the story from a minor character's point of view for a section or two, simply to make sure that their side is aired.  To me, this feels clumsy and unnecessary.  If an author chooses to take a limited perspective, then the reader should sometimes be left without a perfect understanding of the motivations of tertiary characters.  If it's really important to the narrative, the author should use that character throughout the book, rather than just in a passage or two simply to better explain one minor plot thread.  This may just be a pet peeve of mine but, at any rate, I feel this device always detracts from the narrative.As for her characters, I felt that they were uneven.  Erica was the most well-developed, likely because she is the major character.  Erica has some warts, which I liked.  She didn't alienate me with her perfection; rather, I found that I was often able to identify with her insecurities.  However, I couldn't help but feel that she was exploiting the victim's family at times, and this bothered me.  It made her seem a bit underhanded, which really didn't enhance her character.I was quite fond of Patrik who was, for me, Lackberg's most endearing character.  I was especially amused by the parallels between his body insecurities and those of Erica as they began their romance, which I thought was sweet.  Patrik was a bit bumbling, but I also thought he was resourceful and intelligent, and I found the manner in which he hands his boss to be pretty clever, though I did think the boss was overdone and frankly ridiculous.What really does the novel a disservice, in my opinion, is the extraneous detail.  Lackberg has an interesting concept here, and her execution is pretty good.  The problem lies in the sense that the reader has to wade through a lot of unnecessary information in order to get to the plot.  I like literary mysteries, but the authors of this particular genre need to be cautious not to bog the reader down with so many secondary plots that they end up skimming so that they can get back to the real meat of the story.

Simultaneously trying to go through her parents' things and finish work on her fifth book, Erica is finding both tasks distasteful. When her childhood friend is found with her wrists slashed in a frozen bath, Erica begins writing a memoir about her beautiful but remote friend in which she intends to answer questions about their lost friendship.While Falck is conducting her own investigation, local detective Patrik Hedstrom is following his own leads on the woman's death. It is only when Erica and Patrik begin working together that the truth begins to emerge about the small town's past.This is a mystery for those who are character-driven readers. Erica not only writes, grieves for her parents and her lost friendship with the deceased Alex, she has to deal with her younger sister and her grasping husband. Patrik is not only investigating the death of Erica's childhood friend, he has to cope with the boss from hell. Erica and Patrik are attracted to each other, and it's a romance that's well done: enough detail to make romance lovers' toes curl a bit without turning off those who prefer their whodunits with guns and no roses.L&auml;ckberg's interest in people and motivation is clear in The Ice Princess. She also shows a great deal of skill in meting out details to keep the suspense percolating. I can't help but feel that, although she's got two great characters in Erica and Patrik, L&auml;ckberg has the most fun with Patrik's boss, Bertil Mellberg:\"What she considered his most repulsive feature, however, was the atrocious comb-over he had constructed to hide his bald pate. He had let the remaining strands of hair grow out-- his employees could only guess how long they must be-- and then he wound the hair round atop his head in an arrangement that most resembled an abandoned crow's nest.\"What's scary about Mellberg is that, although his characterization borders on buffoonery, L&auml;ckberg doesn't put a foot wrong because I swear I once worked with his twin!Mellberg aside, I truly enjoyed reading this book. L&auml;ckberg is a very visual writer; Scandinavian furniture makers, interior designers and food magazines are mentioned that were totally unknown to me, but I wasn't bothered. That's what an Internet connection and search engines are for. Looking up some of the unfamiliar names helped me see with L&auml;ckberg's eyes and educated me, all at the same time. For those readers who don't care about such things, they are very easily ignored.I deduced what had happened to Alex as a child, but that didn't take away any enjoyment of this book. Good pacing and story combined with excellent characters and motivations to make for a very pleasurable read. I am now looking for the rest of the books in this series because I just have to know about the further adventures of Erica and Patrik.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Enjoy Scandinavian mysteries?

It's not because the narrator was flat, but that the book was so darn good that I couldn't help but want to read it RIGHTNOW to find out what happened.This is the type of work that people will either become entirely engrossed in or be so bored that they'll find themselves counting ceiling tiles. It's very much a character driven book in that the mystery itself isn't entirely the driving force here. There's never a true sense of dread or danger, at least not from the murderer. What dread we do see Erica experience is entirely from the people around her in her day-to-day life. The murder is important and is the impetus for a lot of events, but by large the main point of the novel is to show Erica's life and what motivates her. The death of Erica's old friend Alex is almost incidental at times.That's why I think that a lot of people looking for a more traditional mystery or thriller will probably find themselves a little bored, at least if they're also the type who isn't into works such as this. I remember this getting fairly heavily compared to Stieg Larsson's books, but I can't tell you if it's an apt comparison or not.Overall this really was a great read and while there were a few rough spots here and there, I sped through this fairly quickly.

Shortly after her return, she discovers the body of her childhood best friend, Alex, frozen in the bathtub, apparently dead by suicide.

She's an author.Erica is confronted with the apparent suicide of her childhood friend Alex Wijkner, whom she hadn't seen in twenty-five years. In short order the ME rules the death a suicide and the game is afoot. Erica is aided and abetted by local detective Patrik Hedstrom. Although Erica does some snooping around, Patrik actually does most of the work. They've also known each other since their youth; he's been worshipping her from afar.Agatha Christie's mysteries have an effortless structure to them. Camilla Lackberg was originally an economist, and she's got some shortcomings. For one thing you don't put backstory in the middle of a scene. Then there are some terrible lapses in respect to some of her characters. What's the deal with Eilert Berg for instance? Is he important enough to be included at the beginning and at the end of the story? Then there's police chief Bertil Mellberg who's a complete joke; he even sports a Donald Trump combover that keeps falling off his head. One review refers to him as comic relief, but there's nothing funny about him and he`s just not realistic. The town rich lady Nelly Lorentz sounds like something out of Dickens. Her son Nils' earlier disappearance is another dilemma Erica and Patrik must deal with, and the plot resolution in relation to him is just too convenient to be believed.There are also several minor plot lines that interfere with the flow of the story. Erica's little sister, Anna, is suffering spousal abuse and her husband is bullying her into selling the family homestead. Erica, of course, can't  bear to lose the place.Despite the above, there are several elements that I actually like. Patrik is a likable character and he and Erica make a cute couple. What humor there is in the story occurs during their awkward early relationship. She's been putting on weight, and she's worried he'll think she's fat. Coincidentally he feels the same way about himself and sucks in his stomach around her.Anders Nilsson the tortured artist who had been having an affair with Alex is also an interesting character. I also had no idea who killed Alex Wijkner until Lackberg actually told me, and I can usually spot the killer early on.I'll definitely give her another chance; her work is a touch above what passes for a mystery in America today.

The reason for Erica's return is to take care of the things because of the death of her parents.  Erica is especially looking forward meeting with her best friend from youth, Alexandra Wijkner, but just before she will be back home Alexandra will be found dead, frozen in her bathtub and all indicates that she committed a suicide.Although the two of them broke up contact two years ago and she is not familiar with all the details that have occurred in recent times, for Erica is still hard to believe that her friend decided on such way to end her life because Alex was a beautiful woman, being married to good and successful husband, living a comfortable and almost carefree life.Besides their friendship that makes her to reveal more details, her professional instinct will be too strong therefore Erica will decide to write a work about what happened to Alex. Together with another common friend from the past, local detective Patrik Hedstrom, they two will begin with an investigation to discover all the details.Soon they will discover that there is a lot of things which indicate that perhaps it was not a suicide that happens to Alex, and that a small fishing village beneath the surface hides many dark secrets that obviously influenced the fate of this unfortunate woman...`The Ice Princess' is not a typical thriller that will make reader with its fast pace to constantly turn the pages in anticipation of what will happen, but slowly introduces the reader into the story by offering a quality slowly unraveling plot on this more than 400 pages long novel. Camilla L&auml;ckberg used a lot of psychological motives that may not appeal to everyone because sometimes the author sacrificed the action to clarify one's emotions, thinking or psychological state.It seems that the author had not devoted equal attention to all her characters, because while some are extremely rich and multilayered characterized, some others are almost funny and on the verge of cartoons, seeming a bit unnecessary such as Erica sister - however, it can certainly be attributed to the debut work, and it will be interesting to read the following.The only thing that is not in accordance with the level of quality of the rest of her work is description of the police work that makes it evident about this part the author has not done enough good research.

The Ice Princess is set in a small fishing village in Sweden and is headed by engaging characters Erica and Patrik with an excellent support cast. I enjoy crime stories with a strong sense of place and characters who feel familiar, are flawed, may be likeable but not all will be. So it's a joy to read a book such as The Ice Princess where setting, characterisation and strong plot are not secondary to action and where the characters' lives continue to carry on whilst the crime story itself moves towards climax.Amongst books by other Scandinavian authors, I've read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and stopped at that book in the series. In some ways I enjoyed the book (and movie) but it felt wrong due to the macabre plotting/level of violence against women portrayed. I also believe that book needed stronger editing.... I will not stop on book one by Camilla Lackberg and will read my way through the series.

The final resolution to Alex's death was, as Erika thought, bound in her past, but the incident from the past was too incredibly unbelievable for my mind to handle.

I also find it very hard to believe that so many different people would have engaged in a cover up of this magnitude.It's possible I am just extremely naive or that I do not totally understand the Swedish culture, however the underlying premise behind the crime was just too much for me to accept.

Examples include:  Something is stolen from a room, the protagonist figures out what it is, the author doesn't tell us.  The protagonist makes a phone call, ID's a critical person and hangs up the phone, shocked, but the author makes us wait to find out who it is.

When she sees one of her close friends, Alex Wijkner, in the bathtub with her wrists slit, she assumes the worst and calls the police.Once the police are there, they investigate it and determine that Alex has been murdered and the crime scene was made to look like a suicide.  From there, Ms. Lackberg introduces us to a group of memorable characters and creates a great murder mystery that is compelling from start to finish.Much of the formatting of this book reminds me of one of my favorite authors, John Dickson Carr.  On one hand, it's hard to compare Patrik Hedstrom to Dr. Gideon Fell because Carr based his books on Fell's brilliance in solving crimes.  Lackberg doesn't do that but there isn't a need to do that.  The story is engaging enough that she brings out other characters in the story as well.As far as point of view is concerned, like Carr, Lackberg writes from the point of view from different characters in the story.  Everyone of them has a past and it adds to the mystery to make it hard to put down.Take police chief Helberg for example.  He's the obnoxious boss who draws the wrong conclusions about the murder and is on Hedstrom's back to solve the murder so he can take all the credit for it and be promoted.  He's a comic character as well when we see him in his chair stuffing his mouth with chocolates.The book is not only a mystery but a great story for literary fans as well.  The relationships are dysfunctional and it adds great value to the investigation.  The relationships hit home for Erica also since she is in love with Patrik and her sister is a victim of domestic violence.If you're looking for a book that has a great mystery and memorable characters, then this is for you.

So, when Lackberg's new book is compared to the Scandinavian publishing phenomenon, it doesn't register much with me.Maybe that's a good thing. There's nothing to compare The Ice Princess to. I'm not a reader of the recent craze of Swedish noir, though I will venture into Henning Mankell territory next week. Thus, this novel will be considered strictly on its own merits.The Story:Erica Falck moves to her hometown of Fjallbacka, Sweden after the death of her parents. A writer, she is attempting to finish her fourth biography when she discovers the death of her childhood friend, Alex.  Found in a tub of nearly frozen water with both wrists slashed, Alex's death sets off an investigation to which no one person is exempt. Erica is drawn into the tragedy and mystery surrounding the life and death of her estranged friend. Along with Patrik Hedstrom, a police detective assigned to the case, Erica finds out more about the quiet close-knit seaside community than she ever wanted to know.The Review:There was so much going on in this thriller. A prodigious amount of colorful characters: from the eccentric elderly Mrs. Petren, who uses thousands of Santas and a state of the art coffee machine to ensure a steady stream of guests; to the aging socialite Nelly Lorentz, who is somehow involved in Alex's death; to Alex's sister, Julia, who is grieving in a very unusual way.Lackberg touches on a number of issues--domestic violence, child abuse, negligence, mental illness, and adultery--without devolving into the typical moralistic fare. Every detail of human nature is spot on, except the voice of the victim of domestic violence; in this case, it seems Lackberg consulted case studies and assigned the voice of the psychologist to the victim herself.In addition to that, there was an awkwardness to some of the sentences; I don't know whether that was caused by the translator or the author herself. It's nothing especially jarring, just an awareness of the bump in the flow.In addition to that, one of my chief complaints is that the deceased character seems to be the one most filled with life. Alex is well defined, which distinguishes from most of the other characters. Even Erica's voice didn't seem quite her own (as much as the author's) until about 100 pages in, when the writing noticeably improves and the story becomes more gripping.I've heard that Lackberg's writing improves with each new book, so I'm interested to see how the next one goes.This story was engrossing, the characters profound, and the atmosphere well drawn.The Opinion:Aside from those negatives, The Ice Princess is a fast, light read that will keep you racing through the pages to find answers that will make your jaw drop.

Set in the Swedish coastal town of Fj&auml;llbacka, the book follows well-known biography author Erica Falck, who has returned to the town after the tragic death of her parents in an accident. She plans to stay for a while to get their affairs in order and finish her latest book. One day while on a walk, she is flagged down by an elderly caretaker who has found a disturbing sight--the body of a woman lying in a bathtub of frozen water and blood. It turns out this woman was Alexandra Wijkner, Erica's best childhood friend, from whom she was inseparable, until they were 10 years old, when they inexplicably drifted apart and Alexandra's family moved away. For a woman who appeared to have everything--a successful art gallery, a handsome and wealthy husband, a beautiful and historic home--the idea of Alexandra committing suicide seems difficult for anyone to fathom.Erica is asked by Alexandra's parents to write an article about her for the local newspaper, and as she does research into her life since their friendship ended, she becomes convinced that Alexandra's death might not have been a suicide after all. She also tries to figure out why Alexandra drifted away all of those years ago. Teaming up with Patrik, another childhood friend who is now a police detective, she begins to discover that the case isn't as clear cut as it looks, and there are many secrets many people in Fj&auml;llbacka want to leave hidden.I feel a little bit of pity for any Swedish author whose work gets publicity in America, because they all get compared to Stieg Larsson. And in fact, a blurb on the cover this book says, \"Stieg Larsson fans who give this book a chance will be rewarded.\" I enjoyed this book, but it's nothing like Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, so don't go into this book expecting that. However, many of the characters are richly layered, and while some of the secondary characters were a little too clich&eacute;d for me, the plot took some very interesting twists and kept me flipping pages fairly quickly. Erica wasn't your typical accidental detective and certainly was far from omniscient, and that made her curiousity about the case even more interesting. Apparently this is the first of seven books L&auml;ckberg has written about Fj&auml;llbacka (I know at least the next one features Erica and Patrick), so I'm definitely going to keep reading them.

And perhaps it shoudn't.  In this story of two violent deaths fueled by the simmering resentments and psychopathologies of similarly violent childhoods, Lackberg skillfully weaves multiple perspectives and characterizations to keep the reader guessing up until the bitter end.  So what's the issue?Is it the scores of characters who weave their way in and out of this 400ish page tale of an amatuer writer-detective whose childhood friend is brutally murdered, then left to bleed out and freeze over in her own bathtub?  (I counted at least a dozen different perspectives in the first chapter alone...)Is it the brief descriptions of myriad Swedish exteriors and interiors for which I have no visual reference points?  (I'll look them up now.)Is it that I was expecting an action thriller but got a highly psychological and moderately paced mystery instead?  (Possibly.)I don't know.I do know that if this is considered a suspense novel, as it was described by its publishers, then my previous generalizations about the state of the genre (based on a current bestseller) must be seriously amended.  In fact, The Ice Princess stacks up quite favorably against the current bestseller by a famously prolific author from which I drew my conclusions.  Does this bode well for Lackberg's career and her future novels?  One hopes it does.Did this novel pass the time pleasantly?  Absolutely.  Was the 'Bridget Jones without the humor' heroine reasonably believable and sympathetic?  Indeed.  Did the plot move forward at a steady pace with occasional twists and turns and blind alleyways for good measure?  Yes.  Subplots in which the protagonist's personal life repeatedly intersects with her sleuthing?  Check.  Satisfying romantic developments?  Check.So if you're looking for those qualities in your next light read, and especially if you've ever held a fascination for Swedish culture and scenery, Lackberg's debut on the North American scene will suit the bill nicely.MFB with a fresh perspective on a popular genre,L", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A solid Swedish mystery", "unixReviewTime": 1301529600, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2011"}

There's Alex Wijkner, the murder victim, found partially frozen in the bathtub of her childhood-turned-summer home by the caretaker and Erica, Alex's estranged friend from childhood. Why was she there and not at her home in G&ouml;teborg with her husband, Henrik, Erica wonders. Why had Alex abandon the close friendship with Erica while they were in grade school and moved away without even saying goodbye? Then there is the Lorentz family: mother Nelly, adopted son Jan, and missing son Nils, who simply vanished on January day in 1977 and was never found. Why had Alex kept an article about Nils' disappearance hidden in a drawer in her childhood bedroom? Why had Nelly Lorentz come to Alex's funeral reception and spent most of her time talking to Alex's sister, Julia? And there's the mystery of a painting Alex kept hidden in her closet at Fj&auml;llbacka of herself, naked, painted by her childhood classmate, Anders Nilsson, whose adult life is characterized by frequent extreme drunken binges occasionally interrupted with bouts of creativity.Other, more domestic mysteries, also wind their way through this complex narrative: Will Erica, who has returned to Fj&auml;llbacka after her parents' death in a car accident, keep her childhood home from the greedy hands of her brother-in-law, who she is sure is physically abusing her sister, Anna? What is the issue between Dan, her former lover and still close friend, and his wife, Pernilla? Why does Pernilla, after all these years, suddenly seem to think she and Dan are once again romantically involved?

The novel tells about writer Erica Falck who comes back to her hometown, a small fishing village, only to find her childhood girlfriend, Alex, dead.  At first it seems that Alex has committed suicide, but then the story takes some twists and turns and what seems to be a clear cut case turns out to be anything but.Enter police detective Patrik Hedstrom and his bumbling colleagues at the Tanumshede police station.  Patrik follows his own clues and intuitions about the case, while falling in love with Erica, whom he had a crush on since childhood.  Working together, Patrik and Erica (who is planning a book about the murder while suffering from writer's block) start to piece together the truth about Alex.  The dark secrets which inhibit every small town start to emerge and the people who would like those secrets to remain buried begin to surface.Both Patrik and Erica are well developed, interesting and likeable characters.  The plot is very good and gets better as the characters of Fj&auml;llbacka start to immerge. Lackberg does her best to build suspense and gradually lets out secrets about the community in general and about the murder specifically.I found the setting of a claustrophobic small fishing town of Fj&auml;llbacka to be the most intriguing character.  L&auml;ckberg does a masterful job capturing the feel of a small town with lots of bad history to bury, where every ripple causes a big effect in the lives of many people.  The seemingly idyllic town, where rich people flock to buy summer houses for peaceful, restful and pleasant vacations, holds many dark riddles which the townsfolk would rather be left uncovered.Ms. L&auml;ckberg is a very visual writer; she describes the scenes in a few words which gives the reader a vision to work from in their own minds.  I read about furniture makers I've never heard about, designers I cannot pronounce, and magazines which seem interesting enough for me to look through.  Needless to say Google worked overtime during my reading.\"The Ice Princess\" is interesting but I found it slow at times and had to trudge through the narrative at several places.  The story is slow to start and the book only becomes really interesting towards the latter half.  There are lots of twists and turns, several times I was disappointed and thought I solved the mystery half way through the book, only to find out I was wrong - and happily so.  There are no chase scenes, shootings, brawls or any of the like, the plot woven together tightly with a net spreading around the whole seaside town.However, the story telling is patchy with, what seems to me as simply fillers.  For example, we are privy to Erica's reflections about her new romance with Patrik which did not advance the plot.  Oddly, given the filler material such as what underwear to wear for a date (as if men care), it seems as though the author was rushing through subplots, where a longer book or less subplots might have been better.Even though the story unfolds very slowly, the big ending felt rushed, a \"Star Trek\" ending if you will, where a complex plot is being tied up in a neat package with only five minutes of airtime left.  That's too bad because it was anticlimactic, and after 290 pages we deserve better.Some of the characters speak in a cartoonish way, almost robotic but I don't hold that against the book due to the fact that it was written in Swedish and the prose could have gotten lost in translation.  What I do hold against the English editor and proofreader (assuming there was one) is that there are mistakes in the eBook version (\"ho\" instead of \"no\", etc.).  Those things are simply unacceptable in a finished product - no matter how fast you want to release it to the public in order to capitalize on the \"Swedish crime fiction\" craze sweeping the literary world.That being said, the \"The Ice Princess\" is a good read, not very demanding and an interesting \"who done it\".  Even though I think the editing could have been better, and the translation more fluid, this novel is still a satisfying read.Side note:This is the second Swedish crime novel I've read where the police are portrayed with such high level of incompetence (except the protagonist) that makes the Keystone Cops look proficient.  Also, as in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" series, everyone drinks coffee, or about to drink coffee, or making coffee, or offering coffee - all the time, at every hour of the day or night.  At first I thought it was some sort of an internal joke but now I'm seriously considering buying stocks for companies which produce or import coffee to Sweden.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Intriguing Crime Novel", "unixReviewTime": 1297382400, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011"}

Her unique style and sense of plot have won her numerous prizes, not only in her own country, but throughout the world, where this book has now been translated into twenty-five languages.  The Ice Princess begins mysteriously with an unnamed person finding a woman's body in a filled bathtub in a rural house so cold that ice has formed around her.  Her wrists are slashed in an apparent suicide. The woman is former resident Alexandra Wijkner, nee Carlgren, who grew in this house and who had been visiting it regularly on weekends.  Erica Falck, a writer, had been her best friend until Alex unexpectedly fled Fjallbacka when she was ten.  As Erica begins her research into Alex's life for an article for the local newspaper, she soon finds herself working informally with Patrik Hedstrom, a local policeman who had loved Erica from afar when they were schoolmates.In the course of the novel, the intersecting lives of the townspeople unfold.  Though they are of different social levels, the town is small, and everyone has contact with everyone else.  Lackberg creates her characters from the inside out, letting the characters drive her story, the plot developing in a leisurely way as the author presents scenes from the characters' lives and lets the reader see them as people.  Each has some secret life that is not shared with the rest of the town, and Alex, herself, has secrets which, when revealed, will change the lives of many people in Fjallbacka.For readers accustomed to crime novels filled with macho heroes, extravagant action, chases, shoot-outs, and fights to the death, Lackberg may be a surprise, though the novel certainly has plenty of action.  Her characters are not larger than life--they reflect real life, generally ordinary people, rooted in reality, who, when faced with extraordinary events, try to deal with them in ordinary ways.  As the various characters live their lives and discover tiny pieces of information, the reader begins to acquire a bigger picture of the circumstances surrounding Alex's death.  The mystery is enhanced by five anonymous meditations scattered throughout the novel which reveal the inner world of one or more characters.As in real life, there are some small issues which do not get resolved--we never know why one or two people don't tell the truth--and a few subplots could have used some pruning. Lackberg, the literary juggler, successfully keeps many balls in the air at once, and as an additional death occurs and crimes from the past are discovered, resolution, if not reconciliation, occurs.  The secret underlying all the action is stunning in its depravity and in the lengths to which some people will go to preserve secrecy.  This is a carefully conceived mystery which will delight those whose interests lean toward the inner worlds of the characters rather than their willingness to take up the sword.

Camilla Lackberg was born here, and she brings alive the salty air, the wonderful seascapes, the muscular bodies of the local fisherman, and the sharp tongues of the local gossips.The heroine of this book, Erica Falck, also grew up in Fjallback, and she's going through the house of her recently dead parents when we meet her, trying to get things in order. Almost immediately she's thrown into a sensational murder case. Erica's childhood friend Alexandra is found dead in an icy bathtub, her murder ineptly disguised as suicide.The Ice Princess is not just a murder mystery, but also a love story. Erika, unmarried at thirty-five, gets involved with the divorced police officer investigating the case. He's just her age. Their insecurities (they both weigh a few extra pounds) make for amusing reading as their shy courtship progresses.The relationships in general are quite interesting, since everyone went to school together or interacted somehow with each other in the past. The mystery of who killed Alex is only one of several mysteries and secrets lurking around Fjallback. And Lackberg ties all the complexities of the story together quite deftly. There's even a pleasing cyclical elegance to the plot, which begins and ends with murder.The main characters are full-blooded beings who could be your own friends or relatives.

Erica Falck, coming home to live in her parents' house in a small village after they die, discovers the body of a childhood friend, Alexandra Calgren, apparently a suicide in her own bathtub.Forensics quickly proves that it was no suicide, and the mystery takes off from there.Erica is a writer, and no sleuth, but she discovers important clues that allow her policeman-boyfriend, Patrik Hedstrom, to finally put it all together.But it takes a long time for this to happen.

While Camilla L&auml;ckberg shows some promise, she has a long way to go before she can be considered of similar calibre.The novel's premise is intriguing: writer Erica Falck's best childhood friend, with whom she lost touch, dies suddenly, apparently by her own hand.  As Erica, in tandem with another childhood friend (and eventual love interest), local copper Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m, look into the circumstances further, they find that the explanation is not so simple. Inevitably, they uncover secrets that have been hidden for decades.The claustrophobic small town setting is relatively well drawn, and the novel started off really promisingly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of issues with it that interfere with the flow of the story.  Another reviewer has commented on the numerous \"filler\" scenes, full of redundant information, which bog down the narrative - for example, too frequently we have a scene where Character A tells Character B the same information that the reader has already been told on the previous page. Similarly, while Patrik and Erica are engaging characters, I really did not care about their incipient romance and Erica's repetitive musings on \"Does he like me?  Will I look fat in this?\" became tedious (yes, we even have a Bridget Jones-esque scene where Erica debates whether to go with the lacy undies or the supportive nanna knickers, and just in case we don't get what has inspired this scene, Bridget Jones is helpfully referenced in the text ... mildly amusing at best, but did not advance the plot one jot, and should have been cut). Nor, for example, did we really need to know about the romantic history and family life of Patrik's friend, Robert the forensic scientist - he only appears in a few pages of one chapter.  I found myself skimming those scenes.  Further, I felt that the themes of domestic violence and child abuse were not explored quite as well as they could have been, and dealt with quite simplistically. The big reveals towards the end felt rushed and somewhat anticlimactic.The character development is a bit patchy, partly because there is far too much telling rather than showing, and too many POV shifts. Erica herself, and Nelly Lorentz, a wealthy widow with an apparently inexplicable interest in the deceased's victim's family, are the most well developed and interesting.  Patrik is the standard nice guy, bordering on Marty Stu territory.  By contrast, Erica's sister Anna's husband, Lucas, is a cardboard cutout villain, with no trace of the charm that supposedly led Anna to fall for him in the first place.  While we frequently see him only through the eyes of Erica, who can't stand him, there is no complexity to him at all; this subplot would have been much more effective had he and Erica been on good terms, with Erica slowly becoming uneasy that things are not quite right.  In fact, I think this storyline would have been better dealt with standing alone; it really had little relevance to the major plot.The prose is uneven, especially the dialogue, with characters speaking in an often stilted and unnatural way and overusing each other's names; seriously, no-one in real life talks like that unless they're a telemarketer who rings you in the middle of dinner.  I acknowledge this could at least partly be due to the translation, but unfortunately I don't read Swedish so cannot compare it to the original. Either way, some judicious editing would have helped.I've given it three stars because it is a reasonable, not too demanding holiday read.

Palen Jr. \"Ray\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The greatest contribution the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson made to the world was opening the doors for several other Scandinavian authors to enjoy similar international acclaim.  Larsson's  \"Millennium Trilogy\" (consisting of \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\", \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\" and \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\") are still atop the best-seller's list worldwide and have been made into a successful series of Swedish films (and soon to be American versions directed by David Fincher).Along with fellow authors like Hakan Nesser and Henning Mankell, Camilla Lackberg has joined the fray.  Already dubbed \"The Swedish Crime Queen\", Ms. Lackberg has turned her career as an economist into best-seller stardom all due to taking a course in creative writing that changed her life.  She has been publishing top-selling fiction in Sweden since 2005 and is now beginning to enjoy similar success in the U.S.  Her novel, THE ICE PRINCESS, was originally released in her home country in 2008 and already has received international acclaim.What makes her series of novels so popular --- they feature the unique pairing of authoress Erica Falck and her husband, Detective Patrik Hedstrom.  In THE ICE PRINCESS, Ericka is drawn into the alleged suicide of a childhood friend named Alex.  Those who know Alex best insist this is not a suicide but cold-blooded murder (she was found in a bathtub full of blood).  Toxicology reports support that there may have been a poisoning involved and now everyone in Alex's world is a suspect.To further complicate matters, Erica has decided to base her next novel on the life of her old friend, Alex.  Having lost touch with her for many years, Erica has a good deal of ground to make up.  As her research begins --- initially speaking with family members, her husband, neighbors and friends --- Erica is able to piece a few things together.  First and foremost, Alex may have been having an affair with a mysterious lover.  Secondly, Alex was pregnant when she died --- and the child is NOT her husband's.Simultaneous to Ericka's quest for the perfect expose/novel, Detective Patrik Hedstrom is heading up his own investigation as part of the local Police Department.  Unfortunately, Patrik has to battle with his head-strong boss who wants a slam-dunk conviction (and a good deal of the credit for having neatly solved the murder case).  When the wrong man is initially apprehended and imprisoned, Patrik must go toe-to-toe with his boss to release this suspect who Patrik knows with confidence is not the murderer.  Now, Patrik must race against his own team to secure enough clues and evidence to lead the way to the true killer.It is when the paths of Erica and Patrik cross that the action of THE ICE PRINCESS truly picks up.  Separately, they have had slow and steady success in their respective cases.  Their combined resources, however, prove to be far more formidable.  The pair begins to delve into the dark secrets that lie beneath the surface of the small Swedish town known as Fjallbacka --- and they are not at all prepared for what they will uncover.  Some secrets should remain hidden and darkness inhabits certain residents of this town that may be claiming more than just Alex as a victim of their evil deeds.What Camilla Lackberg does best is using a great deal of `economy' in her language and this allows for a quick read that permits the reader to instantly enter the world she has created and relate intimately with each of the characters she has depicted.  After devouring THE ICE PRINCESS I'm confident most readers will want to read more from Camilla Lackberg.  As more of her work becomes available stateside I can only hope that the word of mouth about this talented author takes flight!Reviewed by Ray Palen for Rebecca Reads", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Chilling American debut by Swedish Crime Queen.", "unixReviewTime": 1308096000, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2011"}

It certainly does have flaws.  However, the ability to write a suspenseful page-turner is a talent in itself.  Think Dan Brown... I don't know if there is any educated person who thinks that Dan Brown's writing is fine literature; nevertheless, he is able to write thrillers which keep readers entertained from start to finish, something which cannot be said for most authors.  Lackberg possesses this skill.I am a big Stieg Larsson fan, and I found many similarities between Lackberg's writing and Larsson's (and not just the copious amounts of coffee consumed by virtually every character.)  The similarities are so numerous that one might wonder if Lackberg copied Larsson, but this cannot be the case since her first book came out 2 years before Larsson's first book hit the shelves in Sweden.  (I do have to wonder how many of the similarities in tone have to do with the fact that The Ice Princess and the Millennium Trilogy were translated into English by the same translator.  I also have to wonder how much of this book and Larsson's books - which are highly popular but also flawed - was lost in translation.)  Lackberg doesn't weave as intricately-detailed a plot as Larsson does, but she has managed to deliver a thoroughly satisfying reading experience.  I enjoyed this book so much that I read it in just two sittings, and hopped on amazon.co.uk to buy two more of her books (she has written nine, four of which are available in the UK, only one of which is available in the US.)If you enjoyed Stieg Larsson's books and have been looking for a similar reading experience, I highly recommend giving Camilla Lackberg a try.  If nothing else, The Ice Princess is a good way to while away an afternoon, and it keeps you guessing for quite some time.  It should not be dismissed because of its flaws - it should be enjoyed for what it is - an entertaining crime novel which, like certain other popular novels - require the reader to suspend disbelief at times (but not too much.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A real page-turner, despite flaws...highly recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1286668800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2010"}

The story takes place in Sweden which spends a good bit of its year in deep cold. Just the cover of this tale will make a reader shiver.After finding out that a female friend of twenty-five years past did not, according to forensics reports, commit suicide, Erica attempts to put together the missing pieces of this woman's life. It appears that all agree with police reports, even though Erica finds Anna's body sitting erect, wrists cut, in a bath with ice across the top of the water.Police testing proceedures show that the young woman's death occurred long before she was propped in the tub so that the water would freeze around her as the temperature dropped far below freezing inside her apartment. A home without a furnace would quickly loose heat in such a subzero climate (-30). In this particular story, exactly when the furnace became out-of-order is a timely clue to the alleged suicidal death.Erica does her best to piece together the missing years of Anna's life. She uncovers secrets about Anna's family and her relationships with various family members. Of course, Erica falls in love with a hunky intelligent policeman, but what would a story be without some form of romance.InThe Ice Princess, it would appear that all family knows more, a lot more. And most of all, what about Anna's mother? What would she know about her children that might better be kept hidden from them and the rest of the world? Is Anna's mother a victim, or a protector for family members who always seem shoved to the background.I enjoyedThe Ice Princessas a mystery. It held me suspended until the awful truth finally surfaces. What I did not enjoy was that as a story, the book was an emotional foxhole. One of the few positive events that happens is the physical and emotional love relationship between Erica and detective Patrick.In that part of the world where ice and snow preside over weather most of the year, this chilling suspense/mystery is just that. It duplicates the weather--it leaves one very cold physically and very chilled emotionally. But then I realize that not all dark stories can have a happy ending.I would recommendThe Ice Princessas a good read, only if you also surround yourself with other stories which have a more balanced, a more pleasurable ideal for the human situation. Cold climate does not necessarily mean a frigid story.Review written by Regis SchilkenAuthor of:Tears of DeceitOther Good Reads:A Foolish PluckingTo Fetch a Thief: A Chet and Bernie Mystery (Chet and Bernie Mysteries)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Frozen Secret in a Suicide", "unixReviewTime": 1302480000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2011"}

Watson", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "I don't know what it is about \"The Ice Princess\" by Camilla Lackberg that makes it so great, but for some reason, I found this impossible to put down.The story is a typical small-town whodunit in which a suspected suicide is found to be a murder.  Writer Erika, and age-old friend of the victim, and her eventual love interest, policeman Patrik, work together to solve the murder, and deal with the other issues in their lives as well.The murder is certainly at the heart of the tale, but I think that what makes this book stand out for me are the number of interesting subplots.  Erika's sister and her husband want to sell the family home, where Erika is currently living, and they have to deal with that stress, as well as the fact that the sister and her husband have some serious marital disputes within themselves to deal with during the course of the narrative.  Patrik and Erika find themselves inexorably drawn to one another, and fill their time wondering how they're going to be covering up their own faults while keeping the other interested.  Erika's best friend's wife is suspicious of her husband's cheating, but should she be?Other reviewers have found these side stories to be unconvincing and plodding, taking away from the rest of the story, but I thought they were probably the best part of the entire book.  I think that they gave a definition to the characters and the town they lived in.  A definite strength of the book is that I feel like I really knew a lot about Fjellbacka (sp?), Sweden, even though this kind of small fishing and tourist town should be completely foreign to me.The murder story was just as captivating.  With plenty of well-drawn characters (although a few standard \"typical villains\" are roaming about), there's plenty to keep you interested in throughout.  Patrik and Erika have to delve into the victim's past, and learn that even though you grow up friends with someone, you never really know everything about them.  There are mysterious disappearances, other side victims, and plenty of stuff to be uncovered, which I think really helped the pacing.I thought the translation was handled pretty well.  There were times when a sentence or two didn't really flow with the paragraph, and there were a few scenes in which characters kept referring to each other by name, but I'm willing to accomodate both of those since this is, of course, a translated novel.  A darn good one at that, and one that I'm recommending to anyone with an interest in murder mysteries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellence in Prose", "unixReviewTime": 1309219200, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2011"}

And after reading that summary I was really looking forward to reading it which may have led to my disappointment. I'll have to admit that I never quite connected with the story though which led to a bit of a disappointing reading experience for me.Let's start with what I liked about the book. I really, really liked the atmosphere that the author created with this book. The descriptions of the setting, the icy cold, all fit perfectly for me as an ideal setting for a thriller. I could feel the cold while I was reading and I loved how just the atmosphere drew me into the book. The mystery was interesting and I'll admit to never having any clue as to who the killer was. The problem that I had with this book was more with never connecting to the characters. The author wrote the story from multiple viewpoints and I found it hard to transition between the characters. I found the switching viewpoints confusing and would have preferred a little more distinction between each character and their thoughts. And I never fully connected with the characters. I liked Erica and Patrik's characters but although I liked them I felt distant from them and what they were going through. The other characters were never fleshed out enough for me to really care one way or another about them. The storyline was good but it moved slowly for me. There wasn't a whole lot of suspense for me but there was a lot of foreshadowing. And I'm going to be honest and say that my dislikes might have just been me with this book. The book was translated and is written by a Swedish author which also makes me wonder if that is why I had problems connecting to the book. It could have just been that it didn't translate well. Maybe if I had read this book written in its' original language then I would have been able to enjoy it more.All in all, I found this to just be an okay read for me.

I'm not enthusiastic about reviewing translated prose.  Am I critiquing the author's writing or the translator's interpretation of it?  Is it fair to judge a book using a stand-in writer as the actual author?  The answers have always been difficult for me to determine.  In this case, I think I've found the resolution.THE ICE PRINCESS is written by Swedish author Camilla L&auml;ckberg and translated by Steven T. Murray.  I checked on Murray to find out if he is a respected translator.  It turns out that he is eminent in his field, having provided translation for 21 Swedish works, 6 Danish and 2 German/Spanish.  Perhaps his best known translation (using the pseudonym of Reg Keeland) is THE GIRL WHO trilogy, the late Steig Larsson's global best selling thriller.  So I'm going out on a limb and declaring that my review will be directed at Camilla L&auml;ckberg, the author.I think the Princess is an excellent book but I have a few misgivings.  This was L&auml;ckberg's first novel and I sensed a lack of originality that new writers often display.  The characterizations, dialogue, plot constructions, and relationships were slightly formulaic.  I know from reading a L&auml;ckberg interview that she is a voracious reader of crime novels and I found traces of writing techniques used by other crime fiction writers which sometimes is indicative of a fledgling's desperate search and failure to find fresh themes and new crime scene techniques.  It wasn't a glaring shortcoming but, in my opinion, it was there.To be fair, I haven't read any of the author's books written since this one, originally published in 2003, so I can't establish if she has modified her writing style.  But, judging from the success of her newer books, my criticism might be somewhat untimely.  I hope, however, that she has pared back the wordiness, eliminated the unnecessary asides, and avoided straying from the theme.  I'll be looking at her newer works to see if she has managed to do that.There's no question about the skills of the author.  She has an enthusiastic and clear writing style.  The structure was solid, the plot was clever, and the final disclosure of the mystery was wonderfully prepared and presented.  I had no trouble in reading the book, enjoying it, and was eager to see how it all evolved.  The setting in a frigid seacoast Swedish village was realistically portrayed and added to the atmosphere of the novel.  Some of the characters were admirable and others were bottom feeders, a successful formula for any good book.I tend to be picky about my crime novels and which ones I read.  There are so many out there and, frankly, some shouldn't be.  Fortunately, Camilla L&auml;ckberg's book is one that shines and, except for my uneasiness about its wordiness, is very enjoyable.

The protagonist is Erica Falck, a writer of literary biographies who, when she returns to her hometown, finds the body of her childhood friend frozen in a bathtub filled with ice-covered water.The intricate story, told from the viewpoints, in third person, of various characters, gradually reveals the town's shocking secrets, which have been kept hidden because of fear of what people might think. The portrayal of characters and their relationships is exquisitely detailed, so that we know exactly what these people are like, and in one case, where we're privy to the thoughts of the indolent, absurdly pompous and overbearing local police chief, hilarious. Yes, this tragic tale is frequently leavened by humor, a quality not notable in other Swedish mysteries I've read. And the humor is light, not dark and morbid as you might expect in a dark crime novel. The winter setting is appropriately chilling. There's romance, too, as Erica teams up with police detective Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m (who, refreshingly, is a stable, cheerful type, not alcoholic or depressed) to investigate the murder.I strongly recommend this book to readers who like Swedish crime fiction and to those who would enjoy a complex contemporary small-town mystery with interesting, well-portrayed characters.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absorbing Swedish mystery with wonderful character portrayal", "unixReviewTime": 1308182400, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2011"}
